## Key Components

### PrimoGPT
- Customized GPT model for financial data analysis and feature generation

### PrimoRL
- Implementation of reinforcement learning models for optimizing trading strategies

### Benchmark Strategies
- Implementation of a basic trading strategy for comparison
- Use of the FinRL library as a reference point

### Analysis and Visualization
- Tools for data processing, NLP feature generation, and result visualization

## Usage

Detailed instructions for running experiments and reproducing results can be found in the individual example directories.

## Development

The project is structured into several key components, each with its own set of examples and implementations. For contributions or questions, please open an issue in this repository.

## Results

Experiment results can be generated using scripts in the `4. Plot results/` directory.
