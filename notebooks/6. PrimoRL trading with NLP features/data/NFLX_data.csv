[Summary]: Airbnb Co-Founder Brian Chesky launched his company in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, born in part by a desire to make some extra cash with former roommate and co-founder Joe Gebbia.

The economy was so bad then, Chesky said Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham warned him “there may be no investors” on Demo Day.

With technology stocks in the midst of their worst sell-off since 2008, Chesky said similar upstarts should brace for a correction “more profound” than the changes seen 14 years ago.

[Summary]: By now, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) investors know the story. SPOT stock is down 65% from its 52-week high; 55% in 2022 and 25% in the last month. It’s fair to say that taking profits from a stock that jumped 149% from its pandemic low is expected. However, the sell-off is now starting to look overdone. But for the time being investors don’t care. In early April, I offered my opinion that Spotify was getting lumped in with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Reed Hastings, chief executive, reversed his longstanding opposition to advertising support earlier this year, when the company’s once-blistering subscriber growth went into reverse in a sign of market saturation in North America.  The new ad-supported service, which launches in November, will “grow membership and, over time, build a significant incremental revenue and profit stream” across the 12 countries it will be available in next month, said Greg Peters, Netflix chief operating officer, on Thursday.

[Headline]: Netflix Stock Tumbles on Report Ad Tier Is Off to Slower-Than-Expected Start
[Summary]: Netflix  shares were trading sharply lower Thursday following a report that the company’s advertising business is off to a rough start.  The streaming video service launched an ad-supported subscription tier early last month, priced at $6.99 a month, below the previous low-end pricing level at $9.99.  The thinking at  Netflix  (ticker: NFLX) was that offering a less expensive version of the service would reduce churn — and attract budget-conscious viewers who might otherwise not subscribe to the service, or would simply “borrow” passwords from friends or family.
[Headline]: Netflix Stock Tumbles Amid Doubts Over New Ad-Service Viewer Targets
[Summary]: Netflix  shares slumped lower Thursday following a report that suggested the online streaming service isn't building a big enough audience in its ad-supported tier to satisfy spending from marketing executives.  Digiday reported that Netflix is having to refund some ad spending commitments amid disappointing subscriber gains in its new ad-supported service, which launched earlier this month.  Digiday said Netflix has structured the deals on a so-called 'pay for delivery' basis, meaning advertisers were effectively guaranteed a certain level of views in order to justify paying for their promotions.

[Summary]: U.S. stock indexes tumbled on Thursday, with both the Dow and S&P 500 poised for their biggest daily percentage drop in three months, as concerns mounted that the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation using aggressive interest rate hikes could lead to a recession.  The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 50 basis points (bps) on Wednesday, dialing back from the four back-to-back 75 bps hikes, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned recent signs of inflation may be waning were not enough to convince Fed the battle against rising prices had been won.

[Summary]: U.S. stock indexes closed sharply lower on Thursday, with each of the major averages suffering their biggest daily percentage drop in weeks, as fears intensified that the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation using aggressive interest rate hikes could lead to a recession.  The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 50 basis points (bps) on Wednesday as was widely expected, downsizing from the consecutive 75 bps hikes at its prior four meetings, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned recent signs of inflation were not enough to convince Fed the battle against rising prices had been won.

Mahaney, who has an outperform rating and $400 price target on the stock for the next year lists Netflix as a top pick in the tech sector.

[Summary]: All eyes will be on Netflix (NFLX) Tuesday afternoon when the streaming giant reports its first quarter earnings. Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet is bullish on the company, giving Netflix a buy rating and a $400 price target, but he still sees challenges ahead. ""The problem is you've got two narratives running through the net ad number,"" Bazinet says. ""You've got the ad tier, which I think is going to be quite positive for net ads over the next three to four years...[but] the noise part of it is they're simultaneously cracking down on password sharing."" Bazinet also tells Yahoo Finance how the combination of these factors could give investors pause Tuesday afternoon, with many focusing on when Netflix will crackdown on password sharing in the United States. However, Bazinet also believes that the long-term picture is a rosy one for Netflix. ""We just need to get through all of this password-sharing noise and just get back to the signal, which is the benefit of the ad tier."" Listen to Dave Briggs and Ines Ferre's entire interview here.

""Love is Blind"" is one of Netflix's most popular reality shows, as people can't seem to get enough of the idea of people ""falling in love"" without ever seeing each other in the flesh.

[Headline]: Netflix in 'transitional phase' and may not see growth until 2024
[Summary]: KeyBanc Managing Director Justin Patterson and CFRA Research Director of Equity Research Ken Leon joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Netflix earnings, advertising, customer base, and the future of the company. Patterson said, 'I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results.' While Leon added, 'this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth.' Full video transcript: Justin Patterson (00:00:06 -> 00:01:05) - Netflix is more of a pricing story. When you think about just the phasing of revenue growth this year and over the medium term, it's really a function of extracting more value from that customer base. Whether it's cracking down on the password sharing or moving from walk to run on the ad service where you have much more ads being delivered, better targeting, and ultimately better monetization of that time spent on the platform. How do you get just users to pay a little more, to consume more ads on a platform, so on and so forth? So I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results. I don't think you'll actually start to see more normalized growth until 2024 when we get out of some of these macro factors near term. And a lot of these product initiatives, just move from initial testing phase toward broader deployment and adoption. Ken Leon (00:01:06 -> 00:01:57) - What does Netflix look like as it goes more significantly to paid sharing or friends and family? We're gonna see that in the second quarter. And the the other issue really relates to the ad pay plan. There hasn't been any cannibalization from the higher ad-free plan. And then advertising revenue really is not gonna be material until next year. And it all, for Netflix, it's kind of, it's not self-inflicted as, but this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth. I have total confidence that their $17 billion content spent on programming and film is the most efficient and highest return, and they got a global platform that enables them to have local programming by country and then share it in other parts of the world.

[Summary]: Striking film and television writers are set to meet with union leadership on Wednesday, the second day of a work stoppage that threw Hollywood into disarray as the industry deals with changes brought on by the streaming TV boom.

[Headline]: Warren Buffett: Here’s how to invest like the Berkshire Hathaway CEO
[Summary]: Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) CEO, is a legendary investor and business magnate who is widely regarded as one of the most successful investors in history. With a net worth of more than $100 billion, recent stock purchases over the last 15 years have helped Buffett’s wealth massively increase. So what exactly is his investment philosophy? It’s centered around the principle of value investing, which involves finding undervalued companies that focus on long-term earnings rather than short-term growth. In other words, rather than buying stocks, he buys businesses that have a competitive advantage. This approach has made him one of the most successful investors in history, and anyone can invest like him by following his strategies. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer zeroes in on the big companies Warren Buffett invests in, including Costco (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO), and breaks down why his investment strategy works, but also, can sometimes cause him to miss out on some big winners.

                [Headline]: Soundstages Were Already Reeling Before This Summer of Strikes. Now What?
[Summary]: Hollywood has lights and cameras, but no action.  Writers aren’t writing and actors aren’t acting, by and large, so cameras aren’t recording and soundstages across the country are silent.  The summer of strikes hit Hollywood and other entertainment hubs after union-affiliated writers and actors walked off their sets in protest against studio executives over contract disputes.
[Headline]: WBD earnings miss: Ad environment is 'just not picking up,"" analyst says
[Summary]: Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares dipped in early trading after its second quarter earnings missed analyst estimates on both the top and bottom line. LightShed Partners Partner Rich Greenfield says the company is ""generating far more cash flow than investors expected when this transaction closed last year,"" however, ""the advertising environment is just not picking up."" Greenfield notes, however, this is a problem for all legacy media companies, not just WBD.  Another concern for Greenfield is the ongoing Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes,""I'm just worried the strike is going to last until October, November,"" he says. Greenfield also says that consumers have far more options for entertainment than they did 10 and 20 years ago and, as a result, ""this is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize.""

[Summary]: Movies such as Dune: Part Two, Challengers, and White Bird are seeing their releases delayed due to the ongoing strikes in Hollywood. Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings. Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""

The stoppage has prevented A-listers from promoting big studio and streamer movies at this year's Venice Film Festival in accordance with union guidance, but the stars of small independent pictures, such as ""Ferrari"", have been given a pass to hit the famed Lido red carpet.  ""Why is it that a smaller distribution company like Neon, like STX International can meet the dream demands of what SAG (the Screen Actors Guild) is asking for ... but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can't?"" Driver told reporters.

                [Headline]: Hollywood strikes: ‘Focus on the consumer,’ MNTN CEO says
[Summary]: There are several issues writers and Hollywood studios are battling over in their contract talks including streaming, AI, and writers’ rooms. Recently, media mogul Barry Diller warned of consequences for studios if they continue partnering with streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX). MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments. “If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.” “Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds.

[Summary]: If you are a customer of Charter's Spectrum (CHTR), you won't be finding Disney-owned channels (DIS) in your cable lineup. Disney pulled its channels from Spectrum amid a carriage dispute between the two companies. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Brett Feldman says there are two reasons why this dispute is happening.  First with the decline in cable subscribers is accelerating, falling about 6% to 7% this year. Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. ""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has ""emboldened"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.  The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the ""point of economic indifference,"" Feldman says. What that means is that given how much cord-cutting is happening, Charter is losing so much profitability in that business and ""basically what they're saying is we almost don't care anymore whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not,"" Feldman says, adding that they are primarily making their money by providing internet service.  Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.

[Headline]: Writers, UAW, UPS strikes: Impact on economy
[Summary]: The Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike continues after over four months of protests against production studios. Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers (UAW) are on the sixth day of their strike against the Big Three automakers: Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Earlier this summer, United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union were able to reach an agreement and avoid a prolonged strike. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss the summer of strikes and the potential impact on the economy. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down the recent rise in work stoppages. Newman was not concerned about the economic impact. He said, ""Economists are now saying, how much damage is this actually going to cause to the broader U.S. economy? And the answer is hardly any."" Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations Senior Economic Advisor Erica Groshen discussed the UAW strike and what it could mean for labor conditions. Groshen said, ""We certainly have a very strong labor market, a very strong economy, and strike activity usually rises when the economy and the labor market is strong."" Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey revealed his concerns over EV production amid the rise in strikes across the country. Bomey stated, ""I think their long-term concern for the automakers is that they come out of this with higher labor costs which makes it more difficult to make EVs at a price point which people can afford."" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley broke down what he referred to as ""the summer of strikes."" Bradley said, ""You have these unrealistic, almost excessive demands on the part of union leadership across a whole host of industry that could ultimately be destabilizing for the entire economy."" Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden discussed the effect of the Hollywood strikes on major studios like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN). Klowden said, ""When we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impact that people are feeling in Hollywood itself but in a number of different places where filming actually takes place. The Hollywood Reporter Media & Business Writer Alex Weprin detailed the content crisis Warner Bros. Discovery and other major studios are facing amid the writers and actors' strikes. Weprin said, ""In the short term, they're going to have all this extra cash ... but in the long term they do need new scripted TV shows and movies in order to conduct their daily business. MNTN CEO Mark Douglas broke down the major issues between writers and Hollywood studios, including streaming and AI. Douglas explained, ""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained."" David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, ""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income."" Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, ""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living."" Wheaton added, ""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).""

[Headline]: Why Netflix is reportedly looking to raise prices for ad-free tier
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is considering raising the price of its ad-free plan after the SAG-AFTRA strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other streamers such as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS), have raised the prices of their ad-free tiers. Third Bridge Analyst Jamie Lumley joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest on Netflix and where the price hikes could start. “On the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive,” Lumley says. As Netflix thinks “about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position, price hikes is one way to really do that.” Lumley notes that streamers are finding increased value “in driving people to the ad-supported tiers.” Ad-supported plans for a lot of streamers have not increased in price so “by raising the price on the ad-free, they’re hoping they can drive further traffic there,” Lumley states.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) will be reporting its third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, October 18. Oppenheimer Managing Director & Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the three things he is watching for in the company's earnings. Helfstein is watching for net subscriber adds, average revenue per membership, and plans for ad-tier. “There is a general view that [Netflix will] beat the overall street estimate. The question's how much they come higher than that?,” Helfstein says. Average revenue per membership, or ARM, was “basically flat year-over-year… but the pushback on the ARM is that if ultimately you’re getting more people to opt into paid sharing... why isn’t it going up more than that?” Netflix “can control the rollout of paid sharing… and they are purposely slow-rolling that. We think they wouldn’t do that if they weren’t otherwise confident in their guidance,” Helfstein adds. Netflix has also said that they will increasing prices after the Hollywood strike ends.

RBC Capital Markets Analyst Gerard Cassidy broke down the recent bank earnings and why RBC is bullish on big banks.

Wall Street Journal Reporter Ben Eisen discussed the concerns of bank executives despite a strong start to earnings season. Eisen said, ""A lot of the bank executives are signaling that we're kind of at a crossroads at this point ... as we get further and further along into this era of higher interest rates that we've seen, we are seeing some of that slowdown come.""

[Summary]: Linear TV and cable providers face challenges stemming from consumers' monumental adoption of streaming services with a variety of broadcast packages attached to them. Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer has been particularly noted as characterizing TV as being in its ""final death throes"" with streamers hammering the final nail into the cable box. Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference to discuss the consolidation possibilities for linear TV networks. Currently, Mayer is unsure whether streamers could be as profitable as traditional TV providers. ""These linear businesses have historically been very profitable — profit margins in the 30 to 40 plus percent, which is incredibly high profits — streaming will probably never get to that profitability level,"" Mayer tells Canal, later highlighting ""horizontal integration"" between Hollywood studios as more likely a scenario for consolidation as competition tightens between streamers.

Sales (00:00:45) Grand Theft Auto V is the most successful of the lot, with Rockstar selling more than 190 million copies, the second best-selling video game ever behind Minecraft.

[Summary]: In this piece, I evaluated two streaming stocks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A closer look suggests a neutral view for Netflix and a bearish view for Roku. While Netflix and Roku both address the streaming media industry, they do so in different ways. In fact, Roku was actually spun off from Netflix in 2008. Netflix is a subscription video-on-demand streaming service that distributes both original and acquired TV sho
[Headline]: Disney, Netflix: Strategist says buy one, avoid the other
[Summary]: It's the battle of the streaming giants. In the debut episode of Good Buy or Goodbye, Sarge986 LLC President Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle explains why he is buying Disney and avoiding Netflix. Guilfoyle likes Disney (DIS) because of its valuation and the activist investment from Trian's Nelson Peltz. Guilfoyle argues that if Peltz can put pressure on CEO Bob Iger and other board members, it can be ""hugely positive, just in perception terms."" Guilfoyle also points to the stock's technicals, saying the stock has support at around $86. As for risks, Guilfoyle says if Peltz's proxy fight fails or Iger doesn't appease him or work out a compromise, it could be ""a big negative for shareholders."" A deep recession would present a downside for Disney stock too, he adds. So what does Guilfoyle not like about Netflix (NFLX)? The stock is ""really expensive relative to Disney"" and the streamer is burning through too much cash, Guilfoyle explains, adding ""they are priced as a growth stock, they are not a growth stock."" Guilfoyle also points to bearish technicals. Guifoyle says his ""panic point"" on Netflix would be if the stock starts to reach a triple top. You can watch more Good Buy or Goodbye by clicking here.

[Headline]: Hollywood studios are expecting a year of changes: Analyst
[Summary]: With the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes over and production resuming on a majority of projects, the question now turns to what lies ahead for 2024? Social media, streaming, and high expenses has some speculating on more mergers in the space, with talk of a potential merger between Paramount Global (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru Founder & Editor, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the state of the box office as well as the potential for mergers among streaming services. Pandya elaborates on the state of media consumption: ""Consumer behavior has changed a lot. There's social media, there's TikTok, there's Instagram. People are spending trillions of minutes on these free platforms and that's trillions of minutes they're not spending watching movies and tv shows. That really begs the question, will we see some M&A activity this year? I think that we will. Between streaming and television and film, a lot of them cannot survive the way that they are right now, so they're kicking the tires.""

""Once they do, we certainly see a clear path forward where you're able to capture more money over time in the gaming segment rather than just buying a particular show or particular movie and you only get that one-time revenue.""

[Summary]: Media giants are facing challenges on all sides, according to recent filings. TV networks like Fox (FOX, FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) are struggling as linear ad revenue enters a ""free fall."" Streaming also remains unprofitable for the majority of players, including Paramount (PARA), Disney (DIS), and Apple (AAPL), as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.

[Headline]: Media's two-sided dilemma: TV networks in free fall as streaming growth stalls
[Summary]: TV networks are in decline while streaming remains an unprofitable entity for the majority of players as costs rise and growth stalls.
[Headline]: Subscribers revolt: Why streaming struggles with retention
[Summary]: According to a report from Antenna, more than 140 million subscribers canceled their streaming plans in 2023, as consumers push back against price increases. However, Antenna finds that almost 25% of those customers re-subscribe within 3 months. Antenna Strategy Director Brendan Brady joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the report, detailing the trends driving the cancelation and re-subscription churn. Brady puts subscriber retention in perspective: ""If you take a cohort of consumers and you see how they sort of decay or cancel over time, it's not linear, right? It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel. So that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods.

[Headline]: How box office hits dominated the Oscars
[Summary]: The Oscars witnessed a triumphant performance from films like Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer, which took home seven wins. While traditional studios raked in the awards, streamers were nearly shut out of the Oscars: Netflix (NFLX) earned 32 nominations, but walked out with a single statue. Chris Fenton, producer and author of ""Feeding The Dragon,"" and Andrew Stachler, CEO of Max Stax Media, to join Yahoo Finance Live and discuss the Oscar's fallout. Fenton notes that Oppenheimer's seven wins ""rewarded this premium experience"" of watching a movie in theaters despite the availability of streaming services. Fenton points out that franchises such as ""Dune,"" ""Mad Max,"" and ""Joker"" have the potential to achieve similar levels of success at next year's Oscars for their ""premium, out-of-home experience."" With massive advertising dollars spent to promote talent, Stachler explains why such spending is necessary. He notes that as talent wins awards, ""it impacts their careers"" and brings attention to the studios that create the movies. However, Stachler acknowledges that the way Oscar wins used ""to drive theatrical box office campaigns"" no longer has the same effect nowadays.

[Headline]: The streaming wars are over. Netflix won: Analyst explains
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) posted its first-quarter earnings, revealing an addition of 9.33 million new subscribers in this quarter, easily beating Wall Street expectations of 5.48 million. The streaming service did, however, share second-quarter guidance that fell below expectations. In addition, the streamer announced that starting next year, it will end its reporting of quarterly membership numbers. Should this worry investors moving forward or is there more at play? Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst Geetha Ranganathan joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into why she has declared Netflix the winner of the streaming wars. Ranganathan explains her stance: ""To a great extent, the streaming wars are kind of over, I think Netflix has kind of won it. And, yes, you're right... this shakeout has been happening in a pretty small way. I think it's going to be happening in a much more aggressive way. We're already seeing talks of consolidation whether it's with Paramount (PARA) or the smaller players, so that obviously is going to play out. We're seeing Netflix also take a complete shift in its content strategy. We used to see them be much more bold with their originals.. There is, of course, now this whole phase of content rationalization... If you look at some of their content titles... they do still have a great mix of their own original content, but we're also seeing a lot of licensed content come on this service.""

                [Headline]: Investor playbook: The biggest earnings surprises so far
[Summary]: Wall Street gears up for a number of big tech earnings this week as many of the tech giants hold much of the value of the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As earnings from the Magnificent Seven roll out, investors may be looking for opportunities to enter the market. Simplify Asset Management Chief Strategist Michael Green and Wealth Enhancement Group Senior Vice President and Financial Advisor Nicole Webb join Market Domination to discuss investment opportunities during this big week of tech earnings and beyond. Webb gives her overview of earnings so far: ""To us, it's just all of this playing out of where does the earnings growth for the rest of the year come from, and we had anticipated a deceleration from those mega tech names in the back half of this year. And so kind of below the surface we see this churning, the broadening that everyone is talking about and some of that relative outperformance from places like the equal weight S&P (^SPXEW)."" Green follows up with: ""I think the biggest surprises that have come out of earnings in general have been things like General Motors' (GM) announcement today that was accompanied by an astonishing buyback where they shrank the quantity of shares by around 17%. This is in contrast, that level of buyback is unprecedented for many of these companies for that to be happening in open markets. And it's just highlighting that the exceptionally cheap areas of the market as long as there's a little bit of support that's coming in through the interest rate space, that really looks like that could be an area of focus.""

[Headline]: Netflix: Sports is the 'go-forward business,' analyst says
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) and the National Football League (NFL) have announced a new partnership to bring NFL games to the streaming platform on Christmas Day. This move marks a significant shift for Netflix as it ventures into the realm of live sports broadcasting. Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet joins Yahoo Finance to provide his insights on this deal. Bazinet highlights his previous concern regarding Netflix's ability to achieve global scalability with its content offerings. He notes that two avenues to attain this scalability are through sports and video games, which Netflix has been actively pursuing. While Netflix was initially hesitant to embrace sports content, Bazinet states that with the NFL deal and the existing partnership with the WWE, Netflix has now officially entered ""the sports business."" ""I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports, and then sort of down the road presumably bidding on more sports rights and doing more advertising. I think it's a good thing, it's just a natural evolution of the business,"" Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode.

[Summary]: Netflix announced it will be the home of Christmas Day football games through 2026. Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian joins Catalysts to discuss the move and the streaming company's dip into the sports world. ""People will know where to go on Christmas Day, particularly those who are Netflix subscribers. And Christmas Day is typically a huge day for Netflix,"" Dergarabedian explains. As families gather together for the holiday, Netflix will likely get a spike in concurrent viewers interested in the big game, he notes. This move, however, won't be Netflix's first sports offering. The company will be home to the highly anticipated boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul on July 20. In addition, Netflix signed a deal with WWE (TKO) to move ""Monday Night RAW"" onto the streaming platform. ""The immediacy of live events is what makes it such a draw for audiences,"" Dergarabedian says of sports programming. He adds that Netflix's move into live sports is about prestige: ""It's about maintaining subscribers, adding new subscribers through the prestige and high profile nature of something like the NFL and NFL games.""

                [Headline]: Consolidation is a 'requirement' in the streaming industry
[Summary]: Paramount (PARA, PARAA) is reportedly looking to merge its Paramount+ streaming service with another platform after previous merger discussions failed to materialize in 2024. Third Bridge Group sector analyst Jamie Lumley and Manhattan Venture Partners head of research Santosh Rao join Market Domination to discuss what's next for the media giant. Lumley notes that Paramount+ trails behind other streaming competitors, the company might consider Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) or Max as a ""good partnership."" Rao adds that consolidation has become a ""requirement"" in the sector as he believes it's necessary to scale. ""As we think over the last few years, this streaming space overall has lost billions and billions of dollars. And it's clear that while there might be some companies here which can reach profitability, it is unlikely that all of them will be able to rebuild these streaming companies or these streaming businesses to offset, for the traditional media companies, the declining revenue and earnings that they had on the traditional linear businesses,"" Lumley says. He adds that bundling services is a way to retain customers and become profitable. Santosh believes that consolidation is ""not going to be a threat"" in the sector: ""There's not going to be a monopoly of search. It's sustainability. And these companies will just not last. So I think it's going to be healthy for the industry."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]: Streamers are doubling down on advertising. Here's why.
[Summary]: As advertisers begin to focus on digital spaces, what does this mean for media companies and how will they make that adjustment? What does it mean for the overall media landscape? University of Michigan Ross School of Business marketing professor Marcus Collins joins Wealth! alongside Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal to discuss how streamers are doubling down on advertising. Collins says that customers are turning to streaming due to its lower cost and content selection. They also aren't as locked into a subscription, so it allows customers to switch between services when they want. Collins adds, ""I think that marketers and brands underwrite everything, right?... The irony of all this is that the streaming model is essentially getting closer to a cable model, just augmented with the agency of allowing subscribers to put up more money to circumvent the ads, or to say, 'I'm going to take the ads so that I don't have to pay.' Essentially, what this is getting to is the closer and closer we get to providing consumers more agency, more flexibility, and more freedom, the business models that are built for that will be the ones that essentially will win out in the end.""

[Headline]: Netflix 'firing on all cylinders' ahead of Q2 earnings
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its second quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday, July 18 as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley — among other firms — have raised their price targets on the streamer. Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan joins Market Domination to break down what investors can expect from the streaming giant's earnings. Ranganathan notes that expectations are ""very, very high"" going into Netflix's second quarter earnings. ""What is really ironic, though, is they are actually trying to move away from subscriber numbers. They said that they're going to stop disclosing subscriber metrics altogether starting in the first quarter of 2025. But I think all of this optimism that we're seeing kind of heading into the second quarter earnings is actually off of subscriber numbers."" She notes that in the first quarter of 2024, Netflix reported 9.3 million new subscriber adds, and it is likely to top the expected 4.7 million in its second quarter. While Netflix's advertising growth has been slower than expected, Ranganathan points to several new opportunities that are appealing to advertisers, from its deal with WWE to the Christmas Day NFL games. She expects these deals to be ""a big bump for their ad business"" as the streaming competition heats up. Ranganathan believes that ""at this point, it's safe to say that Netflix has pretty much won the streaming wars,"" citing the 2 billion viewers reached every day and its broad catalog of content offerings.""The one metric that we really look at when it comes to Netflix and when it comes to all streaming players is engagement. And engagement is very, very high for Netflix. It's higher than almost all of its other competitors."" As Netflix continues facing high expectations, Ranganathan adds, ""I think Netflix is in the best position that it's ever been competitively, and also financially as well as fundamentally. So they're really firing here on all cylinders."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]: Small caps, biggest themes in the media landscape: Catalysts
[Summary]: On today's episode of Catalysts, hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down major market trends from the rise of small-cap stocks to the mergers and acquisitions activity within the media industry. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti believes that small caps are still ""underpriced"" despite the Russell 2000 having ""its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week."" He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: ""I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already."" Retail stocks are on the move as shares of Five Below (FIVE) sink nearly 20% after the retailer announced its CEO Joel Anderson is resigning. The retailer also lowered its second quarter guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Vans parent company VF Corporation (VFC) are jumping on reports that the apparel company will be selling its Supreme brand to European eyewear brand EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA, ESLOY) for $1.5 billion. Paramount Global's (PARA, PARAA) plans to merge with Skydance Media have left investors pondering whether more M&A deals could be in the media landscape's future. As part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special, Market Domination host Josh Lipton breaks down analysts' forecasts for mergers and acquisitions in the media industry and the potential headwinds media companies face as the 2024 presidential election nears. LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield believes that ""no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out,"" believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns.

[Headline]: Should media companies be so focused on M&A, consolidation?
[Summary]: Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav (WBD) made comments over ""real consolidation"" that will take place with media companies over the next few years. Streaming giants have faced many challenges lately with their subscription models but could there be more challenges for the industry ahead? LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to weigh in on the challenges major media companies face with consolidation. Greenfield begins by laying out the problem the older media companies are facing: ""the amount of usage of applications like Peacock (CMCSA) or Paramount Plus (PARA) Plus or even Max pales in comparison to what is happening at Netflix (NFLX) let alone YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL)... Netflix and YouTube, represent over 45% of all time spent streaming on a television. That's just two players dominating. No one ever dominated linear TV the way Netflix and YouTube dominate streaming TV. And that's a huge problem."" Greenfield holds firm to his forecast that ""no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out,"" believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns. ""In general, the Republican Party should be more pro-consolidation. Maybe not so much pro-tech... Obviously, former President Trump has certainly made some pretty aggressive comments about his feelings on Facebook and 'Zuckerbucks.' But, you know, the reality is I do think you're going to see forms of consolidation...""

[Headline]: Netflix will cement its leadership in streaming: Analyst
[Summary]: With over 40 million subscribers on its ad tier, and a focus from marketers on digital advertising, Netflix (NFLX) may be in a great position to dominate the streaming space this quarter. The streaming platform is set to report earnings results on Thursday, July 18. LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for as part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to give insight into Netflix's potential for advertisers. ""I think every investor is going to be interested in what is happening at Netflix on the advertising front, how fast is it growing. They're investing far more aggressively in their own ad technology now. And so I think that's going to be what probably and is that generating more accelerating ARPU [Average Revenue Per User] as you move throughout the year. I think that's going to be a big focus. I mean, overall, Netflix should be in a very strong position heading into the back half of the year.""

Citi managing director Jason Bazinet joins Wealth! to discuss this decision. Bazinet notes that Netflix's restructuring efforts are ""complicated"" as the company strives for profitability. However, he highlights that the ad-tier business has been ""consistent with our expectations,"" with growth in sales, albeit under-monetized. The key question on the Street's mind now is ""can they close that monetization gap by generating more ad dollars off of those ad-tier subscribers?"" On the content front, Bazinet notes that Netflix needs to highlight expansion worldwide. ""The North Star for Netflix is how can they crack the code on spending a dollar on content and having that content resonate globally,"" Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance. ""Right now they're a little bit stuck where they're spending money to gain consumers and viewership in a particular country, but most of those shows aren't traveling around the world.""

[Summary]: Evercore ISI managing director and head of internet research Mark Mahaney joins Catalysts to discuss his top picks in the tech sector ahead of this week's major earnings. ""We've had a big rally in a lot of these stocks. I refer to six stocks as the Super Six.' It's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta [Platforms] (META), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), Trade Desk (TTD). They're all up 30 to 60% year to date. Having said that, it's hard to materially outperform if you're up that much year to date, off of reasonable valuations to begin the year, not off of beaten-down lows, which was the case last year. So I want to be highly selective here,"" Mahaney explains. He is bullish on Alphabet because of its product cycle and growth in its YouTube platform, also pointing to Uber (UBER) as his number two pick, ""I think we just had some dislocation in the stock recently over fears of robotaxis and how that could disrupt ridesharing. I don't think it will. I think robotaxis will be part of the ridesharing solution."" On the other hand, Mahaney does not have Amazon in his top three list of tech stocks despite maintaining its Buy rating. He explains, ""I was a little concerned about some of the iffy retail sales data points that we've seen. April and May were weak. However, June came back gangbusters, so there may not be. There probably isn't a problem with Amazon retail..."" Catch Catalysts' full interview with Mark Mahaney.

[Headline]: Disney may have to pay $5B more for Comcast's stake in Hulu
[Summary]: CFRA research director of equity research Ken Leon joins Catalysts to discuss the state of the streaming industry and some of the challenges traditional media giants are up against. Leon believes that Netflix (NFLX) is the streamer best positioned to capitalize off of ad revenue. He also points to Spotify (SPOT) as a top player in music streaming.  ""Advertisers follow where viewership is growing, which is the continued pivot from legacy networks,"" Leon says. He notes that advertising is increasingly digital, making it ""very agile in terms of turning it on and turning it off."" Therefore, traditional media giants are now competing against platforms like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube TV and TikTok. As Disney (DIS) may have to pay $5 billion more to buy Comcast's (CMCSA) stake in Hulu, Leon explains that CEO Bob Iger is ""looking at streaming besides sports and saying we need general entertainment. So Hulu rounds out our offering along with our family Disney+. That's where we are. The deal will get done."" He anticipates the deal to close by January, and while it may be a significant move for Disney, he adds, ""I'm not sure that's a driver or a catalyst for the stock."" Disney reported an overall earnings beat on its top and bottom line for its fiscal third quarter, the media giant expecting profitability in its streaming segments despite some pressures.

                [Headline]: Streamers are making money, but a lot of them face this problem
[Summary]: Streaming giants Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA, PARAA) both reported earnings this week. Disney reported an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines for its fiscal third quarter, revealing its streaming segment was profitable for the first time. Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA) reported mixed results for its second quarter, with adjusted earnings beating estimates, but revenue falling short of expectations. Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Matthew Dolgin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the streaming landscape. ""All these companies other than Netflix (NFLX) are continuing to make progress, but they are just not there, not mature,"" Dolgin notes, ""the difference with them and Netflix, a decade or less ago, is that they have these other legacy businesses that they're managing. And so they're not getting the pass from Wall Street as streaming continues to grow and is not yet a mature or good business necessarily. They're seeing their other business decline, so they need that to turn."" ""With that said, we're pretty optimistic generally about how things are going in the streaming space,"" Dolgin adds, ""they're making it a better business, but it takes time and in the meantime, their other businesses continue to struggle and that's why the stocks, we think, are remaining under significant pressure."" Watch the video above to hear why Dolgin doesn't think YouTube posts a ""really big"" threat to streamers yet.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.

Rosenblatt Securities managing director Barton Crockett joins Market Domination to discuss Disney's outlook and the state of the overall media industry. ""Disney gets most of its cash flow, a large portion of its value, the majority of its value, I think, from its theme parks. And what was concerning was the turn of the theme parks that we saw in this past quarter, where they had gone from predicting robust growth in operating income, to really expecting some pressure. And that's really in over the past month or two that the consumer has really turned,"" Crockett explains. He notes that parks are one of Disney's ""iconic assets,"" and as seen at the D23 Expo, the company is investing for the ""next generation of families that will bring their kids."" Amid heated streaming wars, Crockett says, ""We've been more constructive on Disney, but that's really on asset value long term anchored on the theme parks, which was challenged this past quarter with the near-term kind of headwinds. So it's a difficult space."" He explains that Netflix (NFLX) ""is clearly running away with the ball,"" and other media companies are struggling to keep up.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is celebrating its 27th birthday on Thursday, with a total of 280 million global subscribers, 23 Oscar wins, and 265 Emmy wins, with its stock at an all-time high. While the company is riding on high, does it have more room to grow? Evercore ISI managing director & head of internet research Mark Mahaney joins Market Domination to discuss Netflix's success and how he believes the company can operate moving forward. Mahaney outlines what will be some of the bigger drivers of growth for Netflix: ""The first is live sports. So we're getting the NFL on NFLX on Christmas Day. And that's a pretty big moment...If the Netflix today is about 75 million households that are subscribing, my guess is if they were to really pick up a big live sports presence, you'd probably get ten, 20 more million more households signing up for Netflix. So I think that's an interesting new growth area."" He continues with: ""And then gaming is another one that, believe it or not, there's, we see this in our surveys, rising usage of Netflix. There's a fair number of games on there. Some of it comes out of their own original IP, intellectual property. And then third is the, the ads business is still a ways away from really moving the needle for Netflix. It just it takes some time. They have to build out the user base. But I think those ad dollars are coming."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination. This post was written by Nicholas Jacobino

[Headline]: Netflix is 'the 800-pound gorilla' of streaming: Strategist
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its third quarter earnings Thursday, with Wall Street anticipating revenue of $9.77 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.16. Annandale Capital founder and chairman George Seay joins Catalysts to discuss these lofty expectations and the streaming giant's potential to outperform. Seay characterizes Netflix as ""a great metaphor"" for the broader stock market, particularly the Nasdaq Composite index (^IXIC). He emphasizes that the company must exceed expectations to maintain its momentum, though it is at the mercy of overall market trends. ""This is one of the must-own companies, but if you don't own it yet, you probably have time to get in once it corrects at some point,"" Seay states. ""We don't know what's going to happen, but it's almost like the market is priced right now where everything's got to go right for everything to keep going up, including Netflix."" Regarding competition, Seay labels Netflix as ""the 800-pound gorilla,"" noting that the company's rivals are ""inept"" in comparison. This dominance, he argues, creates an enormous amount of pricing power for Netflix. ""The execution is outstanding. I think if you talk about internal metrics and the way they operate, you have to be bullish long-term on Netflix,"" Seay tells Yahoo Finance.

                [Headline]: Media M&A unlikely to see uptick under Trump: CFRA analyst
[Summary]: Following Donald Trump's reelection as the 47th President of the United States, media companies are closely monitoring potential regulatory changes that could affect merger and acquisition (M&A) prospects within the streaming space. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav expressed optimism about potential industry changes, noting earlier this week that ""it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation"" that could be ""positive"" and accelerate the industry. CFRA Director of Global Fundamental Research Ken Leon tells Morning Brief that in the streaming space, legacy TV companies are ""trying to catch up to Netflix (NFLX);"" however, ""it's a really tough battle."" He emphasizes that ""overshadowing"" this dilemma are Big Tech companies increasingly entering the streaming space with their own platforms. ""I don't think you're going to see these mega-mergers of... companies that are declining,"" he tells Yahoo Finance, adding that ""technology has created a very different business model that's hard for some of these companies to catch up."" Leon suggests that while a second Trump administration's regulatory policies might create a more merger-friendly environment in the space, the likelihood of large enterprises in the streaming sector being bought out or entering major deals is ""probably not likely."" While discussing earnings results from Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA) and WBD, Leon looks ahead to the expectations for Disney's (DIS) fiscal fourth quarter; Disney will report earnings on Thursday, November 14.

MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the future of TV. Fishman says from an advertising standpoint, linear TV ""is going to continue to come under significant pressure going forward as the eyeballs continue to shift to the connected TV and streaming landscape."" However, as far as the distribution goes and figuring out where the pay-TV floor is, ""we are [becoming] increasingly worried about where that floor really is as a lot of the sports rights continue to go over the top."" Several streamers have pushed into live sports to drive consumers to their streaming services and bundled offerings. As far as what to expect from the media space in the longer term, Fishman says, ""all paths lead back to streaming [as that's] where this industry is going."" Watch the video above for more on the analyst's expectations for Disney (DIS) earnings, his outlook for media consolidation, and his Netflix (NFLX) valuation.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is dipping its toe into live sports. The streaming giant will broadcast the boxing match between social media influencer Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson live on Friday night. Millions are likely to tune in, could more live sports be a catalyst for growth at Netflix? Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Seana Smith speak with Michael Pachter, Wedbush Securities managing director of equity research, about Netflix's future in live programming. ""What broadcast does for Netflix is it allows them to advertise,"" Pachter says. He mentions that one open question he has for Netflix is whether the company will advertise on the rebroadcast of a live program once it's archived, which, Pachter says, is an opportunity for Netflix to make even more money. But not all that glitters is gold. Pachter says that Netflix shouldn't go all in on live sports, telling Yahoo Finance, ""They shouldn't bid for Thursday Night Football or Sunday football. I mean, that's just something that cost them billions of dollars."" Things like the deal Netflix made with WWE to broadcast RAW and Smackdown, on the other hand, Pachter says, are ""pretty smart.""

Netflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion.

[Headline]: Is Netflix due for a stock split? One asset manager weighs in
[Summary]: Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joined Market Domination to discuss the potential for a stock split at Netflix (NFLX). Mahoney noted that Netflix is no stranger to stock splits, having previously executed them in February 2004 and July 2015. With Netflix trading above $900, he explained, ""There's a good precedent that once a stock gets over $600... to do a split."" He pointed to Nvidia (NVDA) as a recent example, which completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year and was subsequently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The CEO further highlighted that a stock split would attract more investors to Netflix shares. The current price may be ""out of reach for the average investor,"" but a split would open the stock to a broader demographic. Mahoney forecasts that Netflix could potentially opt for a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is set to distribute NFL games on Christmas Day, Dec. 25, as part of the streaming giant's push into live programming and sports. Telluride Legal Strategies founder Rob Rosenberg joins Asking for a Trend with Josh Lipton to discuss what to expect from the company's Christmas Day NFL coverage. Rosenberg says he doesn't expect the tech issues that happened with Netflix's Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. ""Streaming is a complex process ... [and] sometimes when demand is huge, it overpowers the system, it overwhelms it. You've got delays, and problems arise. But I would not bet against Netflix. I think that the timing of the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was a great test case for Christmas Day."" ""The best way to get good at streaming at scale is to just do it. There were some hiccups in the fight last month, but I think that they're going to nail it on Christmas Day with these games,"" he adds. ""Up until now, there's been fewer horses in the race [to air sports content], now, with the streamers getting into it,"" Rosenberg says, adding, ""I think that as they develop this expertise where they can deliver these games in a premium experience that people have come to expect from their football, I think that we're going to see more and more competition for these rights as they become available.

[Headline]: Netflix: How live sports will drive the next growth phase
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged 86% in 2024, prompting KeyBanc managing director Justin Patterson to set a new price target of $1,000 for the streaming giant. He joins Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss his outlook on the name for the upcoming year. Patterson notes that Netflix's valuation at 9x forward sales represents ""a top for the stock"" from an EBITDA perspective. He highlights the company's improving free cash flow and its evolution into ""a monetization story,"" supported by upcoming content releases and a move into live sports, which should drive both engagement and price increases. ""What I'm more interested about is the NFL setting up more live events in the future,"" Patterson tells Yahoo Finance. He points to upcoming events like the Women's World Cup, which he believes will attract both new subscribers and advertisers to the platform. ""The interesting thing about Netflix so far is a lot of this growth in 2024 and into the start of 2025 is more sub based; we still haven't had that monetization inflection yet,"" he explains, forecasting this shift for 2025. He adds, ""It makes for a pretty compelling growth profile."" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

[Headline]: NFL scores with Netflix, Pop-Tarts Bowl: YF Sports Report
[Summary]: As the NFL heads into their final week of regular season play, there’s much to discuss around the league both looking back on the recent success from their Christmas Day games on Netflix (NFLX), and also looking forward to what’s in store for the sport in 2025. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano chats with Yahoo Sports Senior NFL Reporter Jori Epstein about all things NFL. Following the Christmas Day games that were streamed on Netflix, the streamer reported both the Ravens-Texans and Chiefs-Steelers games averaged over 24M viewers for each game. Pompliano asks Epstein what she thought was the NFL’s goal by electing to air these on a streamer versus broadcast television or even cable. Epstein attributes the league’s decision to three aspects: increasing their demographic, media rights, and international game play. While broadcast television primarily reaches people of certain ages, opting to stream on Netflix shows the league wants “to meet younger viewers where they’re at,” and increase the demographic range of people watching the sport. Media rights is another factor. With the NFL renegotiating deals again in a few years, Epstein says they are “trying to generate as much revenue as possible,” with hopes to increase the amount of bidders vying for the league’s broadcast rights. The third aspect is the growth of the NFL on an international scale. “They’ve already increased their international slate from up to five [games] a year to up to nine a year going into 2025,” Epstein explains. “The more viewers they have interested in [playing internationally], the more they're going to be able to create that revenue when they go play in those countries.” Plus, Pompliano takes a look at some of the most viral moments from college football's Pop-Tart Bowl, which took place last weekend, where the Iowa State Cyclones defeated the Miami Hurricanes 42-41.
