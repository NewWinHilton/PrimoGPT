                [Headline]: What Can Disney or Netflix Do To Stop Password Sharing ?
[Summary]: For a long time, Netflx had a laissez-faire attitude toward password sharing, as did most of the other streaming services.  Other streaming platforms, like Disney+, have had the same issues of password sharing — a recent report found that Disney+ has five moochers for every one actual subscriber.  Netflix's current program to curb sharing also isn't that aggressive.
[Headline]: The one thing keeping streaming TV from completely taking over
[Summary]: Now that being a cable television cord cutter is no longer outlier territory, the streaming audience has matured into the next phase: optimization.  Viewers who have embraced the new landscape of streaming TV options like Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video are now looking for a solution to cut though the competitive clutter.  Nearly half of those surveyed think that the wider range of streaming TV options now available has made it more difficult to discover and select the content they want.
[Headline]: Here's How Much Money Password Sharing Costs Netflix, Disney
[Summary]: Plenty of people either let their adult child, ex-partner or best friend use their Netflix  or HBO  account — or are the best friend or adult child using someone else's accounts.  Now, at least one streaming service is slowly taking steps to put a stop to it.  Netflix recently announced plans to roll out a feature in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru that will charge users a little bit extra for sharing their accounts (i.e., letting people use their passwords) with up to two people outside their household.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) stock is becoming increasingly attractive as it innovates its product offerings, according to one Wall Street Analyst. Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI’s Senior Managing Director & Head of Internet Research points to Netflix’s ad-tier rollout and its subsequent lower priced options as key catalysts for the stock over the next twelve months. Mahaney, who has an outperform rating and $400 price target on the stock for the next year lists Netflix as a top pick in the tech sector. Netflix’s password crackdown weighed on shares over the last several months but have since rebounded as investors shift their focus to the the increased revenue Netflix could gain from more users paying their own way to use the platform, Mahaney argues. The analyst’s price target reflects nearly 30% upside from where Netflix shares closed on Friday and comes along other top picks in the tech sector such as Meta (META) and Uber (UBER).

[Summary]: Netflix  released its long-delayed “Love is Blind” cast reunion show on Monday afternoon, nearly a full day after the show—which the company had planned to air live—was supposed to debut.  Many users who tried to tune in to the live show at 8 p.m. ET Sunday saw a message on their TVs saying there was an issue with the live stream that Netflix was trying to fix as soon as possible.  Instead of playing the show live, Netflix pivoted to filming the episode and released it Sunday evening after more than an hour delay.
[Headline]: Netflix Is in Hot Water for Epic Livestream Failure
[Summary]: In theory, live streaming is an exciting step forward for the entertainment industry.  The ability for outlets like Netflix or YouTube to stream an event as it happens in real time allows these relative upstarts to compete directly with broadcast television behemoths like ABC and NBC, which still attract massive audiences thanks to their ability to seamlessly broadcast live events like the Super Bowl, NBA finals and the Oscars.  ""Love is Blind"" is one of Netflix's most popular reality shows, as people can't seem to get enough of the idea of people ""falling in love"" without ever seeing each other in the flesh.

[Summary]: All eyes will be on Netflix (NFLX) Tuesday afternoon when the streaming giant reports its first quarter earnings. Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet is bullish on the company, giving Netflix a buy rating and a $400 price target, but he still sees challenges ahead. ""The problem is you've got two narratives running through the net ad number,"" Bazinet says. ""You've got the ad tier, which I think is going to be quite positive for net ads over the next three to four years...[but] the noise part of it is they're simultaneously cracking down on password sharing."" Bazinet also tells Yahoo Finance how the combination of these factors could give investors pause Tuesday afternoon, with many focusing on when Netflix will crackdown on password sharing in the United States. However, Bazinet also believes that the long-term picture is a rosy one for Netflix. ""We just need to get through all of this password-sharing noise and just get back to the signal, which is the benefit of the ad tier."" Listen to Dave Briggs and Ines Ferre's entire interview here.

[Headline]: Are AI job wages of up to $900,000 justified?
[Summary]: Streaming platform Netflix (NFLX) is sharing artificial intelligence job postings offering salaries of up to $900,000. NYU Professor Vasant Dhar sits down with Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall to discuss whether these AI jobs wages are wholly justified amid widespread artificial intelligence adoption and current labor market conditions. ""Assuming [these companies] get some clarity around what AI really means for their business, these numbers are justified,"" Dhar states. ""Now, the trouble is that there's a high variance in people's abilities and skills to actually translate something into real sort of money, business profits."" Inversely, companies have sought value and efficiency through the adoption of AI models this year, resulting in layoffs and projected downsizing. ""We should not conflate the ability of the computer to speak well with knowledge,"" Dhar says, adding: ""The thing to keep in mind is that these pre-trained models make it easy to build applications really quickly, but they'll inherit the limitations of these models.""

[Summary]: Movies such as Dune: Part Two, Challengers, and White Bird are seeing their releases delayed due to the ongoing strikes in Hollywood. Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings. Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""

[Headline]: Hollywood strikes, subscriber churn, sports rights: Big media woes
[Summary]: Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""

[Summary]: If you are a customer of Charter's Spectrum (CHTR), you won't be finding Disney-owned channels (DIS) in your cable lineup. Disney pulled its channels from Spectrum amid a carriage dispute between the two companies. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Brett Feldman says there are two reasons why this dispute is happening.  First with the decline in cable subscribers is accelerating, falling about 6% to 7% this year. Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. ""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has ""emboldened"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.  The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the ""point of economic indifference,"" Feldman says. What that means is that given how much cord-cutting is happening, Charter is losing so much profitability in that business and ""basically what they're saying is we almost don't care anymore whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not,"" Feldman says, adding that they are primarily making their money by providing internet service.  Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.

[Headline]: Writers, UAW, UPS strikes: Impact on economy
[Summary]: The Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike continues after over four months of protests against production studios. Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers (UAW) are on the sixth day of their strike against the Big Three automakers: Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Earlier this summer, United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union were able to reach an agreement and avoid a prolonged strike. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss the summer of strikes and the potential impact on the economy. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down the recent rise in work stoppages. Newman was not concerned about the economic impact. He said, ""Economists are now saying, how much damage is this actually going to cause to the broader U.S. economy? And the answer is hardly any."" Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations Senior Economic Advisor Erica Groshen discussed the UAW strike and what it could mean for labor conditions. Groshen said, ""We certainly have a very strong labor market, a very strong economy, and strike activity usually rises when the economy and the labor market is strong."" Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey revealed his concerns over EV production amid the rise in strikes across the country. Bomey stated, ""I think their long-term concern for the automakers is that they come out of this with higher labor costs which makes it more difficult to make EVs at a price point which people can afford."" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley broke down what he referred to as ""the summer of strikes."" Bradley said, ""You have these unrealistic, almost excessive demands on the part of union leadership across a whole host of industry that could ultimately be destabilizing for the entire economy."" Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden discussed the effect of the Hollywood strikes on major studios like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN). Klowden said, ""When we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impact that people are feeling in Hollywood itself but in a number of different places where filming actually takes place. The Hollywood Reporter Media & Business Writer Alex Weprin detailed the content crisis Warner Bros. Discovery and other major studios are facing amid the writers and actors' strikes. Weprin said, ""In the short term, they're going to have all this extra cash ... but in the long term they do need new scripted TV shows and movies in order to conduct their daily business. MNTN CEO Mark Douglas broke down the major issues between writers and Hollywood studios, including streaming and AI. Douglas explained, ""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained."" David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, ""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income."" Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, ""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living."" Wheaton added, ""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).""

[Summary]: After 146 days, WGA has reached a tentative deal with Hollywood studios, which is one of the steps need to get film and television production going again. Needham & Co. Senior Analyst Laura Martin explains how strikes could impact the volume of content that streaming services produce. “Wall Street is demanding they.. move to profitability faster,” Martin says. For streamers, this could mean cutting down seasons by filming fewer episodes—“less content spending”, as Martin notes. Martin expects consolidation in the industry, which will help “get rid of duplicative costs.” In regards to smaller streamers, Martin states that due to large competitors such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) “there’s no advantage to being small.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

[Headline]: Why Netflix is reportedly looking to raise prices for ad-free tier
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is considering raising the price of its ad-free plan after the SAG-AFTRA strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other streamers such as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS), have raised the prices of their ad-free tiers. Third Bridge Analyst Jamie Lumley joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest on Netflix and where the price hikes could start. “On the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive,” Lumley says. As Netflix thinks “about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position, price hikes is one way to really do that.” Lumley notes that streamers are finding increased value “in driving people to the ad-supported tiers.” Ad-supported plans for a lot of streamers have not increased in price so “by raising the price on the ad-free, they’re hoping they can drive further traffic there,” Lumley states.

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) will be reporting its third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, October 18. Oppenheimer Managing Director & Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the three things he is watching for in the company's earnings. Helfstein is watching for net subscriber adds, average revenue per membership, and plans for ad-tier. “There is a general view that [Netflix will] beat the overall street estimate. The question's how much they come higher than that?,” Helfstein says. Average revenue per membership, or ARM, was “basically flat year-over-year… but the pushback on the ARM is that if ultimately you’re getting more people to opt into paid sharing... why isn’t it going up more than that?” Netflix “can control the rollout of paid sharing… and they are purposely slow-rolling that. We think they wouldn’t do that if they weren’t otherwise confident in their guidance,” Helfstein adds. Netflix has also said that they will increasing prices after the Hollywood strike ends.

[Headline]: Streaming: Is consolidations of linear TV networks likely?
[Summary]: Linear TV and cable providers face challenges stemming from consumers' monumental adoption of streaming services with a variety of broadcast packages attached to them. Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer has been particularly noted as characterizing TV as being in its ""final death throes"" with streamers hammering the final nail into the cable box. Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference to discuss the consolidation possibilities for linear TV networks. Currently, Mayer is unsure whether streamers could be as profitable as traditional TV providers. ""These linear businesses have historically been very profitable — profit margins in the 30 to 40 plus percent, which is incredibly high profits — streaming will probably never get to that profitability level,"" Mayer tells Canal, later highlighting ""horizontal integration"" between Hollywood studios as more likely a scenario for consolidation as competition tightens between streamers.

Norton also shared his thoughts on the state of the tech industry, streaming, and the use of AI in the entertainment business. ""How good can it be, and does it really wipe away the human input or not? I really don't think so,"" Norton explained on AI. ""I think that these things will largely become to be seen as tools, much like CGI."" On Netflix and traditional linear TV Norton said ""I think what we're going to see very soon is that there is no linear television at all. Everything is everything everywhere all at once."" Norton added ""You will stream on demand whatever you want, and if you don't want to pay for premium ad-free, you'll just watch it with ads. And what that means is suddenly Netflix is one of the largest television ad supported networks in history, and that means that that's why it has to be negotiated now. The pie is about to get bigger."" Click here to watch more from Yahoo Finance Invest.

[Headline]: Disney, Netflix: Strategist says buy one, avoid the other
[Summary]: It's the battle of the streaming giants. In the debut episode of Good Buy or Goodbye, Sarge986 LLC President Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle explains why he is buying Disney and avoiding Netflix. Guilfoyle likes Disney (DIS) because of its valuation and the activist investment from Trian's Nelson Peltz. Guilfoyle argues that if Peltz can put pressure on CEO Bob Iger and other board members, it can be ""hugely positive, just in perception terms."" Guilfoyle also points to the stock's technicals, saying the stock has support at around $86. As for risks, Guilfoyle says if Peltz's proxy fight fails or Iger doesn't appease him or work out a compromise, it could be ""a big negative for shareholders."" A deep recession would present a downside for Disney stock too, he adds. So what does Guilfoyle not like about Netflix (NFLX)? The stock is ""really expensive relative to Disney"" and the streamer is burning through too much cash, Guilfoyle explains, adding ""they are priced as a growth stock, they are not a growth stock."" Guilfoyle also points to bearish technicals. Guifoyle says his ""panic point"" on Netflix would be if the stock starts to reach a triple top. You can watch more Good Buy or Goodbye by clicking here.

[Summary]: With the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes over and production resuming on a majority of projects, the question now turns to what lies ahead for 2024? Social media, streaming, and high expenses has some speculating on more mergers in the space, with talk of a potential merger between Paramount Global (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru Founder & Editor, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the state of the box office as well as the potential for mergers among streaming services. Pandya elaborates on the state of media consumption: ""Consumer behavior has changed a lot. There's social media, there's TikTok, there's Instagram. People are spending trillions of minutes on these free platforms and that's trillions of minutes they're not spending watching movies and tv shows. That really begs the question, will we see some M&A activity this year? I think that we will. Between streaming and television and film, a lot of them cannot survive the way that they are right now, so they're kicking the tires.""

""It's just the adoption rate that we're worried about, if you will, in terms of being able to monetize the actual product,"" Mulberry says on Netflix's gaming model. ""Once they do, we certainly see a clear path forward where you're able to capture more money over time in the gaming segment rather than just buying a particular show or particular movie and you only get that one-time revenue.""

[Headline]: Netflix Declared Victor in 'Streaming Wars'
[Summary]: Netflix is poised to strengthen its position as the leading streaming service due to changes in the last 18 months that include evolving industry dynamics, talent strikes and an investor focus on profitability.

""It is becoming increasingly clear that Netflix has won the 'streaming wars.'""  Since Netflix can now buy more from outside providers it won't have to finance as much new production and can instead spend on established content, Reif Ehrlich says.

[Summary]: Media giants are facing challenges on all sides, according to recent filings. TV networks like Fox (FOX, FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) are struggling as linear ad revenue enters a ""free fall."" Streaming also remains unprofitable for the majority of players, including Paramount (PARA), Disney (DIS), and Apple (AAPL), as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.

[Headline]: Subscribers revolt: Why streaming struggles with retention
[Summary]: According to a report from Antenna, more than 140 million subscribers canceled their streaming plans in 2023, as consumers push back against price increases. However, Antenna finds that almost 25% of those customers re-subscribe within 3 months. Antenna Strategy Director Brendan Brady joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the report, detailing the trends driving the cancelation and re-subscription churn. Brady puts subscriber retention in perspective: ""If you take a cohort of consumers and you see how they sort of decay or cancel over time, it's not linear, right? It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel. So that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure and if you remove Netflix (NFLX) from that calculation, it goes up to 45% so nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure and that's really when you're most at risk to cancel.""

                [Headline]: How box office hits dominated the Oscars
[Summary]: The Oscars witnessed a triumphant performance from films like Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer, which took home seven wins. While traditional studios raked in the awards, streamers were nearly shut out of the Oscars: Netflix (NFLX) earned 32 nominations, but walked out with a single statue. Chris Fenton, producer and author of ""Feeding The Dragon,"" and Andrew Stachler, CEO of Max Stax Media, to join Yahoo Finance Live and discuss the Oscar's fallout. Fenton notes that Oppenheimer's seven wins ""rewarded this premium experience"" of watching a movie in theaters despite the availability of streaming services. Fenton points out that franchises such as ""Dune,"" ""Mad Max,"" and ""Joker"" have the potential to achieve similar levels of success at next year's Oscars for their ""premium, out-of-home experience."" With massive advertising dollars spent to promote talent, Stachler explains why such spending is necessary. He notes that as talent wins awards, ""it impacts their careers"" and brings attention to the studios that create the movies. However, Stachler acknowledges that the way Oscar wins used ""to drive theatrical box office campaigns"" no longer has the same effect nowadays.

[Headline]: Investor playbook: The biggest earnings surprises so far
[Summary]: Wall Street gears up for a number of big tech earnings this week as many of the tech giants hold much of the value of the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As earnings from the Magnificent Seven roll out, investors may be looking for opportunities to enter the market. Simplify Asset Management Chief Strategist Michael Green and Wealth Enhancement Group Senior Vice President and Financial Advisor Nicole Webb join Market Domination to discuss investment opportunities during this big week of tech earnings and beyond. Webb gives her overview of earnings so far: ""To us, it's just all of this playing out of where does the earnings growth for the rest of the year come from, and we had anticipated a deceleration from those mega tech names in the back half of this year. And so kind of below the surface we see this churning, the broadening that everyone is talking about and some of that relative outperformance from places like the equal weight S&P (^SPXEW)."" Green follows up with: ""I think the biggest surprises that have come out of earnings in general have been things like General Motors' (GM) announcement today that was accompanied by an astonishing buyback where they shrank the quantity of shares by around 17%. This is in contrast, that level of buyback is unprecedented for many of these companies for that to be happening in open markets. And it's just highlighting that the exceptionally cheap areas of the market as long as there's a little bit of support that's coming in through the interest rate space, that really looks like that could be an area of focus.""

[Headline]: Netflix: Sports is the 'go-forward business,' analyst says
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) and the National Football League (NFL) have announced a new partnership to bring NFL games to the streaming platform on Christmas Day. This move marks a significant shift for Netflix as it ventures into the realm of live sports broadcasting. Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet joins Yahoo Finance to provide his insights on this deal. Bazinet highlights his previous concern regarding Netflix's ability to achieve global scalability with its content offerings. He notes that two avenues to attain this scalability are through sports and video games, which Netflix has been actively pursuing. While Netflix was initially hesitant to embrace sports content, Bazinet states that with the NFL deal and the existing partnership with the WWE, Netflix has now officially entered ""the sports business."" ""I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports, and then sort of down the road presumably bidding on more sports rights and doing more advertising. I think it's a good thing, it's just a natural evolution of the business,"" Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode.

[Headline]: Joey Chestnut, Takeru Kobayashi to compete in Netflix competition
[Summary]: After organizers for Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog-eating contest said Joey Chestnut wouldn’t compete this year because of a deal with a rival brand, Netflix swiftly announced a new hot dog-eating competition that will feature Chestnut and his “fiercest rival.”  Chestnut, a 16-time hot dog-eating champion, will face off with his frequent Nathan’s competitor, Takeru Kobayashi, in a live Netflix special on Sept. 2, the streamer announced Wednesday.  The contest, titled “Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef,” will feature the two chowing down on all-beef hot dogs, likely in a nod to reports that Chestnut’s rival brand deal is with Impossible Foods, which makes plant-based hot dogs.

                [Headline]: Consolidation is a 'requirement' in the streaming industry
[Summary]: Paramount (PARA, PARAA) is reportedly looking to merge its Paramount+ streaming service with another platform after previous merger discussions failed to materialize in 2024. Third Bridge Group sector analyst Jamie Lumley and Manhattan Venture Partners head of research Santosh Rao join Market Domination to discuss what's next for the media giant. Lumley notes that Paramount+ trails behind other streaming competitors, the company might consider Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) or Max as a ""good partnership."" Rao adds that consolidation has become a ""requirement"" in the sector as he believes it's necessary to scale. ""As we think over the last few years, this streaming space overall has lost billions and billions of dollars. And it's clear that while there might be some companies here which can reach profitability, it is unlikely that all of them will be able to rebuild these streaming companies or these streaming businesses to offset, for the traditional media companies, the declining revenue and earnings that they had on the traditional linear businesses,"" Lumley says. He adds that bundling services is a way to retain customers and become profitable. Santosh believes that consolidation is ""not going to be a threat"" in the sector: ""There's not going to be a monopoly of search. It's sustainability. And these companies will just not last. So I think it's going to be healthy for the industry."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]: Netflix 'firing on all cylinders' ahead of Q2 earnings
[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its second quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday, July 18 as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley — among other firms — have raised their price targets on the streamer. Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan joins Market Domination to break down what investors can expect from the streaming giant's earnings. Ranganathan notes that expectations are ""very, very high"" going into Netflix's second quarter earnings. ""What is really ironic, though, is they are actually trying to move away from subscriber numbers. They said that they're going to stop disclosing subscriber metrics altogether starting in the first quarter of 2025. But I think all of this optimism that we're seeing kind of heading into the second quarter earnings is actually off of subscriber numbers."" She notes that in the first quarter of 2024, Netflix reported 9.3 million new subscriber adds, and it is likely to top the expected 4.7 million in its second quarter. While Netflix's advertising growth has been slower than expected, Ranganathan points to several new opportunities that are appealing to advertisers, from its deal with WWE to the Christmas Day NFL games. She expects these deals to be ""a big bump for their ad business"" as the streaming competition heats up. Ranganathan believes that ""at this point, it's safe to say that Netflix has pretty much won the streaming wars,"" citing the 2 billion viewers reached every day and its broad catalog of content offerings.""The one metric that we really look at when it comes to Netflix and when it comes to all streaming players is engagement. And engagement is very, very high for Netflix. It's higher than almost all of its other competitors."" As Netflix continues facing high expectations, Ranganathan adds, ""I think Netflix is in the best position that it's ever been competitively, and also financially as well as fundamentally. So they're really firing here on all cylinders."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]: Streamers are doubling down on advertising. Here's why.
[Summary]: As advertisers begin to focus on digital spaces, what does this mean for media companies and how will they make that adjustment? What does it mean for the overall media landscape? University of Michigan Ross School of Business marketing professor Marcus Collins joins Wealth! alongside Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal to discuss how streamers are doubling down on advertising. Collins says that customers are turning to streaming due to its lower cost and content selection. They also aren't as locked into a subscription, so it allows customers to switch between services when they want. Collins adds, ""I think that marketers and brands underwrite everything, right?... The irony of all this is that the streaming model is essentially getting closer to a cable model, just augmented with the agency of allowing subscribers to put up more money to circumvent the ads, or to say, 'I'm going to take the ads so that I don't have to pay.' Essentially, what this is getting to is the closer and closer we get to providing consumers more agency, more flexibility, and more freedom, the business models that are built for that will be the ones that essentially will win out in the end.""

[Summary]: On today's episode of Market Domination Overtime, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the market close and some of the biggest stories to watch on Thursday, July 18. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sunk by 512 points — or 2.77% — in Wednesday's trading session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also closed 1.39% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) saw a 0.60% bump higher to a new record high. Markets have taken a turn as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) makes gains while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lag from pressure facing the chip sector. Kestra Investment Management CIO Kara Murphy says, ""If you look at over the last six months, 80% of the constituents of the S&P 500 have underperformed the index... Now all of a sudden, we get a couple of good inflation prints, a couple good labor prints. Looks like Fed can start to cut interest rates, and all of a sudden, the macro environment starts to change. And I think this is a hint of what is going to turn out to be a broader trend."" She encourages investors to start rotating out some mega-cap names for some smaller-cap and mid-cap names, explaining that with mid-caps, ""you have companies that are a little bit more established, a little bit more mature, a little bit more diversified, better balance sheets in general, but largely ignored by a lot of the market."" United Airlines (UAL) posted mixed second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.14 topped estimates of $3.93. Operating revenue of $15.0 billion was about in line with the estimated $15.04 billion, but passenger revenue of $13.68 billion was just shy of the expected $13.74 billion. The airliner disappointed with its third quarter outlook, projecting adjusted earnings of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, coming in below the anticipated $3.38. Third Bridge global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy Peter McNally explains, ""most of the market has gotten this heads up now that the airline industry is softening. There's just too much capacity right now and we're at a peak demand season. And it's weighing on the revenues outlook."" He adds, ""it gets more interesting for United longer term,"" as capital expenditures seem lower year-over-year and Boeing's (BA) deliveries slow. He notes that United's future plans depend on getting new planes from Boeing, and he's keeping a watchful eye on how those plans get pushed. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is currently in talks to by cybersecurity firm Wiz for a deal valued around $23 billion, according to Bloomberg. As the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have been recently pushing back on a number of Big Tech deals, Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan breaks down why a potential Alphabet-Wiz deal is unlikely to evade regulator scrutiny. Finally, Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down what to watch on Thursday, July 18, from the end of the Republican National Convention to major earnings including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Netflix (NFLX).

LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for as part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to give insight into Netflix's potential for advertisers. ""I think every investor is going to be interested in what is happening at Netflix on the advertising front, how fast is it growing. They're investing far more aggressively in their own ad technology now. And so I think that's going to be what probably and is that generating more accelerating ARPU [Average Revenue Per User] as you move throughout the year. I think that's going to be a big focus.

[Summary]: Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav (WBD) made comments over ""real consolidation"" that will take place with media companies over the next few years. Streaming giants have faced many challenges lately with their subscription models but could there be more challenges for the industry ahead? LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to weigh in on the challenges major media companies face with consolidation. Greenfield begins by laying out the problem the older media companies are facing: ""the amount of usage of applications like Peacock (CMCSA) or Paramount Plus (PARA) Plus or even Max pales in comparison to what is happening at Netflix (NFLX) let alone YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL)... Netflix and YouTube, represent over 45% of all time spent streaming on a television. That's just two players dominating. No one ever dominated linear TV the way Netflix and YouTube dominate streaming TV. And that's a huge problem."" Greenfield holds firm to his forecast that ""no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out,"" believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns. ""In general, the Republican Party should be more pro-consolidation. Maybe not so much pro-tech... Obviously, former President Trump has certainly made some pretty aggressive comments about his feelings on Facebook and 'Zuckerbucks.' But, you know, the reality is I do think you're going to see forms of consolidation...""

[Summary]: Netflix (NFLX) reported its second-quarter earnings results, alongside announcing plans to discontinue its cheapest ad-free plan in the US and France. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet joins Wealth! to discuss this decision. Bazinet notes that Netflix's restructuring efforts are ""complicated"" as the company strives for profitability. However, he highlights that the ad-tier business has been ""consistent with our expectations,"" with growth in sales, albeit under-monetized. The key question on the Street's mind now is ""can they close that monetization gap by generating more ad dollars off of those ad-tier subscribers?"" On the content front, Bazinet notes that Netflix needs to highlight expansion worldwide. ""The North Star for Netflix is how can they crack the code on spending a dollar on content and having that content resonate globally,"" Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance. ""Right now they're a little bit stuck where they're spending money to gain consumers and viewership in a particular country, but most of those shows aren't traveling around the world.""

[Headline]: CrowdStrike outage, Netflix earnings: Asking for a Trend
[Summary]: On today's edition of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the biggest themes and stories hitting the market, from the CrowdStrike outage to new technology in cars. The CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage did more than sink the cybersecurity provider's stock on Friday; a CrowdStrike update impacted Microsoft Windows (MSFT) systems leading to worldwide tech outages and massive headaches for banks, airlines, and even emergency services. Market Domination host Julie Hyman details the pain points felt by these industries over the course of the day. Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre discusses some of the top market trends of the day, from a rotation out of Big Tech to a crash in the price of copper (HG=F). Netflix (NFLX) recently reported its second quarter earnings, revealing a gain of 8 million paid subscribers. Ish Entertainment Founder & CEO Michael Hirschorn joins Asking For A Trend for Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next to give insight into Netflix's earnings and why the streaming giant seems to be standing out among the rest. He says, ""I think that the trend that is not discussed all that much that I think is pretty important is the retreat from what's called SVoD, which is the subscription video on demand, and the move towards what's called AVoD, which is advertising video on demand. So Netflix and some of the other platforms have been pushing their subscribers away from from a paid subscription model to what has become a more lucrative advertising model, which should sound familiar to people because it's kind of the same model that existed in cable."" Luxury auto brand Lincoln made a surprising list — AdAge's list of America's hottest brands. The brand is seeing a revival thanks, in part, to a commercial for its Nautilus SUV. Yahoo Finance autos reporter Pras Subramanian explains how the Nautilus' high-tech features are attracting younger buyers. This post was written by Melanie Riehl

[Headline]: CrowdStrike sinks on outage, energy sector struggles: Morning Brief
[Summary]: On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the market open and some of the biggest stories dominating the trading week. All three of the major averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by over 0.3% at the market open. The tech-heavy indexes are being dragged down as markets react to global outages tied to a CrowdStrike (CRWD) update. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has identified the source of the disruption as a flaw in a single update for certain Microsoft (MSFT) Windows hosts. CrowdStrike's CEO says that the issue has been identified so it companies can fix the issue. Defused Cyber Deception researcher and founder Simo Kohonen emphasizes CrowdStrike's reputation as the ""top number one cybersecurity company in the world"" and notes that their extensive customer base amplifies the scale of this issue. He adds, ""I think CrowdStrike will have a lot of conversations with their current customers and their future customers about what they're doing differently. They might take a short-term hit from it, but they're still an extremely reputable vendor."" Netflix (NFLX) shares have been on the move after reporting second quarter earnings results after Thursday's market close. The streamer topped estimates and revealed it added 8 million subscribers despite missing Wall Street expectations for third quarter earnings guidance. TD Cowen managing director John Blackledge notes that management expects margins to continue to rise in the next year, and points to the growth of its ad tier: ""They were pretty bullish on the long term. And also kind of on the near term. They expect the ad tier to reach critical scale by next year in all 12 of the AVoD [Advertising-based Video on Demand] markets."" As the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has climbed by nearly 200 points in the past week and a half, Carson Group Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick discusses why a potential rotation out of big Tech may not entirely be ""shocking."" ""I think we expected this type of move [out of Tech]. And honestly, guys, we think it's going to continue,"" he says, adding, ""Doesn't mean we hate tech. We're more neutral tech, but we really think these other underloved, underappreciated, and under-owned areas are probably going be pretty good the second half of this year."" Finally, the energy sector is slipping as shares SunPower (SPWR) tanked around 30% on Friday morning after the company reportedly notified dealers that as of September 17, it will no longer support new leases and halt shipments. This move comes after the company announced in April that it will have to restate almost 2 years of financial results. Similarly, shares of Plug Power (PLUG) are sliding after the company announced a $200 million common stock offering. The company claims the offering is for ""general corporate purposes.""

[Headline]: Netflix earnings, housing market, layoff concerns: Wealth!
[Summary]: On today's episode of Wealth! host Brad Smith breaks down key personal finance stories from the CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage to what home buyers need to know before entering the housing market. A recent CrowdStrike update caused a global outage that impacted Microsoft Windows (MSFT) systems across multiple industries. The incident has affected or even halted operations in banking, airline operators, and even emergency services around the world. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley provides a detailed analysis of the incident, shedding light on the concerns surrounding the small group of companies that are responsible for operating internet systems globally. Netflix (NFLX) reported its second-quarter earnings results and announced plans to discontinue its cheapest ad-free plan in the US and France. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet notes that Netflix's restructuring efforts are ""complicated"" as the company strives for profitability. However, he highlights that the ad-tier business has been ""consistent with our expectations,"" with growth in sales, although it has been under-monetized. Meanwhile, the tech sector (XLK) is continuing to see a downturn as some investors on Wall Street are rotating out into other sectors and small-cap stocks (^RUT). EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro comments on which areas of the market will be most sensitive to rate cuts: ""That's capital-intensive industries, right? Where you've got not the greatest— where they're trying to get the profitability, right? You've got a lot of debt on the books. You really have to be cautious."" Many would-be homebuyers are choosing to sit on the sidelines and instead rent for longer as housing costs remain elevated. Yahoo Finance contributor Ross Mac joins Wealth! to break down some scenarios where either buying or renting could make the most sense for you. Chase Home Lending Head of Consumer Originations Sean Grzebin believes the housing market is getting some relief, explaining, ""Now that rates have been high for some period of time, we're starting to see a little easing. I think customers are becoming more comfortable listing, and we're actually seeing inventories grow for the first time in several years."" 70% of employees are bracing for potential layoffs, whether by saving money or applying to new jobs, according to a survey from MarketWatch Guides. MarketWatch Guides data journalist Matt Brannon lays out one of the biggest finds in the study: ""One of the big ones is that age gap. So we found that Baby Boomers feel more secure in their jobs. It makes sense. They've worked for decades building up their seniority. Whereas Gen Z workers, 88% are taking steps to prevent, a job loss trying to preempt it in some sort of way, layoff anxiety is a term that we asked about to find out just how concerned people are and a majority of Gen Z workers and nearly half of Millennials are anxious about being laid off.

""We've had a big rally in a lot of these stocks. I refer to six stocks as the Super Six.' It's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta [Platforms] (META), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), Trade Desk (TTD). They're all up 30 to 60% year to date. Having said that, it's hard to materially outperform if you're up that much year to date, off of reasonable valuations to begin the year, not off of beaten-down lows, which was the case last year. So I want to be highly selective here,"" Mahaney explains. He is bullish on Alphabet because of its product cycle and growth in its YouTube platform, also pointing to Uber (UBER) as his number two pick, ""I think we just had some dislocation in the stock recently over fears of robotaxis and how that could disrupt ridesharing. I don't think it will. I think robotaxis will be part of the ridesharing solution."" On the other hand, Mahaney does not have Amazon in his top three list of tech stocks despite maintaining its Buy rating. He explains, ""I was a little concerned about some of the iffy retail sales data points that we've seen. April and May were weak. However, June came back gangbusters, so there may not be. There probably isn't a problem with Amazon retail..."" Catch Catalysts' full interview with Mark Mahaney.
