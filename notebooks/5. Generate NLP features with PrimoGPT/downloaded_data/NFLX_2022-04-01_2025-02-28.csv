Patterson said, 'I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results.' While Leon added, 'this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth.' Full video transcript: Justin Patterson (00:00:06 -> 00:01:05) - Netflix is more of a pricing story. When you think about just the phasing of revenue growth this year and over the medium term, it's really a function of extracting more value from that customer base. Whether it's cracking down on the password sharing or moving from walk to run on the ad service where you have much more ads being delivered, better targeting, and ultimately better monetization of that time spent on the platform. How do you get just users to pay a little more, to consume more ads on a platform, so on and so forth? So I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results. I don't think you'll actually start to see more normalized growth until 2024 when we get out of some of these macro factors near term. And a lot of these product initiatives, just move from initial testing phase toward broader deployment and adoption. Ken Leon (00:01:06 -> 00:01:57) - What does Netflix look like as it goes more significantly to paid sharing or friends and family? We're gonna see that in the second quarter. And the the other issue really relates to the ad pay plan. There hasn't been any cannibalization from the higher ad-free plan. And then advertising revenue really is not gonna be material until next year. And it all, for Netflix, it's kind of, it's not self-inflicted as, but this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth.

Douglas explained, \""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained.\"" David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, \""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income.\"" Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, \""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living.\"" Wheaton added, \""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the\u00a0NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).\"" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman 00:00:27 - Erica Groshen, Cornell University 00:00:40 - Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey 00:00:58 - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley 00:01:15 - Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden 00:01:31 - The Hollywood Reporter Media & Business Writer Alex Weprin 00:01:49 -\u00a0MNTN CEO Mark Douglas 00:02:03 -\u00a0 American Worker Project Senior Adviser David Madland 00:02:21 - Art Wheaton, Cornell University ILR School"", ""source"": ""Yahoo""}, {""date"": ""20230921224400"", ""headline"": ""Netflix (NFLX) Resurrects Onimusha with Epic Anime Revival"", ""summary"": ""Netflix (NFLX) breathes new life into the legendary Onimusha game with an epic anime adaptation."", ""source"": ""Yahoo""}, {""date"": ""20230921234520"", ""headline"": ""Netflix (NFLX) Stock Moves -0.56%: What You Should Know"", ""summary"": ""In the latest trading session, Netflix (NFLX) closed at $384.15, marking a -0.56% move from the previous day."", ""source"": ""Yahoo""}, {""date"": ""20230922040500"", ""headline"": ""Next FTC Lawsuit May Hit Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Tuesday"", ""summary"": ""Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

However, Antenna finds that almost 25% of those customers re-subscribe within 3 months. Antenna Strategy Director Brendan Brady joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the report, detailing the trends driving the cancelation and re-subscription churn. Brady puts subscriber retention in perspective: \""If you take a cohort of consumers and you see how they sort of decay or cancel over time, it's not linear, right? It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel. So that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure and if you remove Netflix (NFLX) from that calculation, it goes up to 45% so nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure and that's really when you're most at risk to cancel.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Ranganathan explains her stance: \""To a great extent, the streaming wars are kind of over, I think Netflix has kind of won it. And, yes, you're right... this shakeout has been happening in a pretty small way. I think it's going to be happening in a much more aggressive way. We're already seeing talks of consolidation whether it's with Paramount (PARA) or the smaller players, so that obviously is going to play out. We're seeing Netflix also take a complete shift in its content strategy. We used to see them be much more bold with their originals.. There is, of course, now this whole phase of content rationalization... If you look at some of their content titles... they do still have a great mix of their own original content, but we're also seeing a lot of licensed content come on this service.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

Webb gives her overview of earnings so far: \""To us, it's just all of this playing out of where does the earnings growth for the rest of the year come from, and we had anticipated a deceleration from those mega tech names in the back half of this year. And so kind of below the surface we see this churning, the broadening that everyone is talking about and some of that relative outperformance from places like the equal weight S&P (^SPXEW).\"" Green follows up with: \""I think the biggest surprises that have come out of earnings in general have been things like General Motors' (GM) announcement today that was accompanied by an astonishing buyback where they shrank the quantity of shares by around 17%. This is in contrast, that level of buyback is unprecedented for many of these companies for that to be happening in open markets.

Collins says that customers are turning to streaming due to its lower cost and content selection. They also aren't as locked into a subscription, so it allows customers to switch between services when they want. Collins adds, \""I think that marketers and brands underwrite everything, right?... The irony of all this is that the streaming model is essentially getting closer to a cable model, just augmented with the agency of allowing subscribers to put up more money to circumvent the ads, or to say, 'I'm going to take the ads so that I don't have to pay.' Essentially, what this is getting to is the closer and closer we get to providing consumers more agency, more flexibility, and more freedom, the business models that are built for that will be the ones that essentially will win out in the end.\"" Watch the video above to hear what Collins says about more streamers adding live sports.

While Netflix's advertising growth has been slower than expected, Ranganathan points to several new opportunities that are appealing to advertisers, from its deal with WWE to the Christmas Day NFL games. She expects these deals to be \""a big bump for their ad business\"" as the streaming competition heats up.

Remember, in a few months, they are going to stop disclosing subscriber metrics. They really want to position themselves as a top-line growth story and definitely as a bottom-line growth story as well.\"" Ranganathan says the next step investors want to see from Netflix is a price hike. \""A price increase is long overdue, and I think that's really what investors are looking for,\"" she says, adding, \""You look at the valuation of this stock, I mean that it's premium valuation, there's no doubt about it. Revenue growth is really kind of what underpins that that lofty valuation. And for you to have consistent revenue growth, obviously, you need those price increases. And why not?\"" The analyst says Netflix has the pricing power and engagement to justify increasing prices, but \""They're just waiting to see how to kind of implement that price increase. They're going to have to do it very carefully because, remember, they're trying to balance subscriber growth along with revenue growth. At the same time, they also have to grow their advertising tier, and how much they grow their advertising tier will depend on how they price the ad-free tier because if they really increase the price substantially, they could end up driving a lot more subscribers to that ad-based tier and beefing up their advertising revenue... it's going to be a really careful balancing act.\"" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.

MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills \u201cThe move towards ad-supported customers is doing something very interesting [for] Netflix. It's essentially making it a growth stock and a value stock at the same time. The reason I say that is they're adding ad-supported customers at a significantly faster rate than they're monetizing them. So that's creating a big revenue backlog that they'll tap into in maybe two to three years,\u201d Douglas says. He explains that Netflix\u2019s shift into ad-supported subscriptions is similar to its password-sharing crackdown, which boosted subscriber growth. \u201cA few years ago, it was so easy to get into a Netflix account using your friend's or family member's account. Then they just kind of slightly locked down on that and had an explosion of subscribers and an explosion of revenue. This is essentially similar. You know, it's basically creating this revenue backlog that they'll tap into.\u201d \u201cAnother way to think about it is you could predict that Netflix will do a, let's say, a two times price increase in two years, except the subscriber is not going to pay for it. The advertiser is,\u201d he says, explaining that with the ad-supported tier, Netflix is driving significant revenue from advertisers rather than directly from users. Douglas notes, \u201cA little secret in media is that the advertiser media companies want you to like ads\u2026 They love when you're in the ad-supported tier, not in the ad-free tier. It makes them a lot more money\u201d as it\u2019s \u201ckind of double dipping\u201d with advertisers and users driving revenue.

Netflix (NFLX) reported better-than-expected third quarter results, sending the streaming giant\u2019s shares higher and fueling bulls' confidence. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cThe fundamentals were really good, so there's nothing really to pick out there. What I'm a little bit nervous about is what I would just call the sort of shifting bull case on the stock.\"" He explains that the bar keeps getting higher for the bull case of the stock with accelerating multiple expansion. Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addresses a key question for the North American market: \""Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?\"" He notes that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter. Mega-cap tech stocks, which are part of the Magnificent Seven, will kick off earnings season with Tesla (TSLA) to report third quarter earnings results next week.

Basically, in the high interest rate environment, you saw a lot of investors flock to the Mag seven names because they had size and safety,\"" O'Rourke tells Seana Smith and Brad Smith. According to a Wall Street Journal report, OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) have engaged an external adviser to determine the equity stake Microsoft will receive for its $14 billion investment in OpenAI. This evaluation comes as OpenAI transitions from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.

This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano chats with Yahoo Sports Senior NFL Reporter Jori Epstein about all things NFL. Following the Christmas Day games that were streamed on Netflix, the streamer reported both the Ravens-Texans and Chiefs-Steelers games averaged over 24M viewers for each game. Pompliano asks Epstein what she thought was the NFL\u2019s goal by electing to air these on a streamer versus broadcast television or even cable. Epstein attributes the league\u2019s decision to three aspects: increasing their demographic, media rights, and international game play. While broadcast television primarily reaches people of certain ages, opting to stream on Netflix shows the league wants \u201cto meet younger viewers where they\u2019re at,\u201d and increase the demographic range of people watching the sport. Media rights is another factor. With the NFL renegotiating deals again in a few years, Epstein says they are \u201ctrying to generate as much revenue as possible,\u201d with hopes to increase the amount of bidders vying for the league\u2019s broadcast rights. The third aspect is the growth of the NFL on an international scale. \u201cThey\u2019ve already increased their international slate from up to five [games] a year to up to nine a year going into 2025,\u201d Epstein explains. \u201cThe more viewers they have interested in [playing internationally], the more they're going to be able to create that revenue when they go play in those countries.\u201d Plus, Pompliano takes a look at some of the most viral moments from college football's Pop-Tart Bowl, which took place last weekend, where the Iowa State Cyclones defeated the Miami Hurricanes 42-41.
