The $8.4bn New York-based fund, led by Jeff Smith, set out its argument in a presentation published on Tuesday.  It attributed Salesforce’s valuation discount relative to its peers to a “subpar mix of growth and profitability”.
[Headline]: UPDATE 1-Activist Starboard focusing on profitability at Salesforce, Splunk and Wix
[Summary]: Activist investor Jeffrey Smith said on Tuesday his investment firm Starboard Value was currently involved with Wix.com, Splunk and Salesforce, and was engaged with management for ways to bolster valuations of these high-growth companies.  Smith said the common theme among all three companies was that the level of growth they were promising had not translated into appropriate profitability and, therefore, value for its shareholders.  ""We need to appeal to the management team to be as competitive at producing value for shareholders,"" Smith said of Salesforce, noting it had market-leading positions among all of its products and a highly competitive culture.

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation.

[Headline]: Tech earnings: What investors have learned so far
[Summary]: So far, six of the ""magnificent seven"" tech companies have reported their quarterly results: Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA). Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon. Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.

Rangan says what he's telling clients ""to look for is what kind of uptick we’re going to see with generative AI"" in calendar ’24. Rangan notes that ""we’ve seen a slew of launches"" from companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Adobe (ADBE), and these companies are hoping ""to get more customer wallet share in return for all the productivity."" ""So when is that going to start to really manifest in revenue?,"" Rangan says. The second thing is ""what’s happening with macro?,"" Rangan says. Last year, ""we were heading into this inflation spiral... company growth rates start to really decelerate,"" Rangan notes, but ""now, we’re at a point where things are stabilizing."" So, Rangan says, ""what is your macro outlook? What is the pulse of the spending environment?"" and ""what do budgets for calendar ’24 look like?"" The third thing is, ""when are you going to start to hire?,"" Rangan says. ""There’s no growth in the software industry unless you really hire,"" Rangan explains. We’ve seen layoffs and hiring freezes, but when is ""that going to start to turn around?,"" Rangan adds.

Even Elon Musk has committed to San Francisco,"" Breed says, emphasizing the city's reality from perceptions of crime and retail theft: ""And so I think that the story and what people are trying to paint is a moment in time. It's the challenges that exist, with some of the issues that other big cities are facing all over the country.""

[Summary]: A lot has changed from last year's Salesforce Dreamforce conference. The biggest is the focus on AI. Salesforce Co-Founder and CEO Marc Benioff (CRM) tells Yahoo Finance that AI is ""the most exciting business opportunity of our lifetime, maybe any lifetime."" ""Every business will get recreated with artificial intelligence. People are here trying to do that,"" Benioff says. Benioff says in his business, for example, AI is helping engineers become more efficient. Benioff also discusses what AI means for his business and the importance of protecting customer data. AI LLM systems are ""hungry for your data, your personal data, your company data. Our customers are not so quick to turn over all their corporate assets to these LLMs,"" Benioff says, adding that his company has a ""trust layer"" to help companies protect data. Benioff argues that AI is coming in four different waves. The first is predictive, which has existed for the last several years. Currently, we are in the generative AI wave. The third wave will bring more autonomy, where ""you have the software working on our behalf."" The final stage is where AI is ""kind of thinking for you,"" citing popular pop culture AI systems such as HAL. When it comes to how fast AI is developing, Benioff says, ""things are happening much faster than any of us realize.""

Alex Zukin, Wolfe Research Managing Director & Head of Software Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the upgrade as well as what could happen if Salesforce got involved in a potential merger or acquisition. ""If they do go down that road, I think the ability to... pick and choose and very cogently outline the profitability potential, and the accretion potential of the M&A is going to be very important,"" Zukin says on M&A activity. ""My opinion is that you're going to be looking at Salesforce to do more tuck-ins, more [of] the aqua-hire type of deals rather than the big meaty diluted M&A of the past.""

                [Headline]: Bill Gates, Nasdaq, Verizon CEOs on AI: Davos highlights
[Summary]: Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland continues as Yahoo Finance sat down with top leaders to discuss the impact of AI. Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. “AI can be used… for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon…. Whenever we have new technologies, they’re used to achieve positive goals and… for some challenging things as well,” Gates notes. “When we computers, books, video games... we had to think… what’s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those… negative things.” Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that “AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you’ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta’s AI products have benefited advertisers. “Back in ’22, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they’re doing that is because it’s giving them better targeting and better performance,” Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that “generative AI will be important for our... business.” “When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it’s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains “what’s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then… how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the “exciting opportunities” that come with AI. “I’m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we’re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been… traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,” Benioff says. “Right now AI can really… make people a lot better.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. “I think it’s incredibly early… with AI right now,” Robbins says. “As this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp explains that “76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they’re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it’s the future. And that it’s actually mainstream at this point.” “It really is getting to the point where we’re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,” Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company’s drug development. “Impacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,” Narasimhan notes. “It is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.” Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI “is an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and… ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.” “We’ve been… engaging in artificial intelligence for… well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services. Gen AI gives another gear to that,” Smith adds.

[Headline]: Bill Gates, will.i.am, top execs on AI: Davos best moments
[Summary]: Advancements in artificial intelligence have been one of the biggest stories of 2023 and remain a trending topic for 2024. As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I found it's a real productivity increase,"" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. ""Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better."" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, ""Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at."" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, ""We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability."" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, ""I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network."" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, ""We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons."" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, ""I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have."" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, ""There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still."" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, ""It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast."" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, ""I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question."" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, ""Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big."" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, ""We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost."" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, ""It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.""

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) has joined a now long list of companies that announced layoffs in the tech sector. According to data from Layoffs.fyi, the announcement brings the total number of layoffs in the tech sector 24,000 so far in 2024. Should others in the tech industry take this as a sign of things to come? University of Michigan's Ford School Professor of Public Policy and Economics Betsey Stevenson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the status of the labor trends in large tech companies. Stevenson puts the current market in historical context, reminding that the tech sector over hired during the pandemic. ""It's obviously not as booming as a labor market as it was... a year and a half ago, but the question will be, is this tech sector a canary in the coal mine? Or is this more re-allocation to places where we need people more than we need them in the tech sector?"" Stevenson states. ""I think we do still have a healing economy, so I feel very confident that people are going to be reabsorbed into other parts of the labor market.""

                [Headline]: Salesforce history: Beyond the Ticker
[Summary]: Over the past quarter of a century, Salesforce (CRM) has become one of the global leaders in the cloud-based software industry. In 2022 alone, Salesforce's revenue topped $31 billion, a more than 18% year-over-year increase. But what led to Salesforce's growth in the cloud computing industry? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at some of the company's biggest moments. 1999 Salesforce was founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez, specializing in software as a service (SaaS). 2000 The dot com bubble burst, and the company was forced to lay off 20% of its employees. On February 7, 2000, Salesforce.com officially launched an event themed around “The End of Software” at San Francisco’s Regency Theater featuring The B-52s. 2003 Salesforce continued to grow, with its revenue skyrocketing to over $100 million by December 2003. 2004 In June 2004, the company went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange at $11 per share. 2009 Salesforce had an annual revenue of just over $1 billion. That same year, Salesforce launched Service Cloud for customer service and support automation. 2014 Salesforce debuted Trailhead, a free online learning platform empowering anyone — regardless of education level — to develop the skills needed to land top tech jobs. 2016 The company launched Einstein, the first comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) technology for customer relationship management (CRM), making AI accessible to every company and business user. 2020 Salesforce was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing energy giant ExxonMobil (XOM). 2021 Salesforce completed the acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date. 2023 The company introduced the next generation of Einstein AI, Einstein GPT, the world’s first generative AI for CRM. From its humble beginnings to a market cap of over $276 billion, Salesforce now stands as one of the world's most distinguished software companies. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

[Summary]: (Reuters) -Salesforce expanded its stock buyback program by $10 billion and announced a new dividend, but its annual revenue forecast that was below estimates pushed its shares down around 2% in after hours trading.  The company's downbeat forecast signals a likely slowdown in cloud and tech spending as clients grapple with high interest rates and rising inflation, compelling them to keep a lid on costs.  Warnings of a slow economy prompted Salesforce to cut about 700 employees, or roughly 1% of its global workforce, last month, adding to the slew of layoffs across the tech and media industry.

[Summary]: Shares of Salesforce (CRM) are moving up as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 versus an expected $2.27. The company did, however, forecast a weak sales growth of only an estimated 8.6% growth. In addition, the company announced it will eventually be issuing dividends to shareholders. Macquarie Head of AI & Software Research Fred Havemeyer joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Salesforce's earnings and what to expect from the company going forward. Havemeyer speaks on the shareholder dividend news: ""With the addition of a dividend here and the company also consistently returning capital to investors through buybacks, what we're seeing is that we believe Salesforce here is really showing their dedication to deploying their cash flows in ways that are rewarding investors and their confidence in Salesforce. And so, where the company is focusing again on profitability and cash flows, and growing those cash flows nicely, north of 20% year-over-year in 2025, fiscal '25, they see this as an opportunity to return more cash to shareholders."" He continues: ""It adds a very nice aspect to this story, that you can follow along for the growth, for the upside from AI, but you're also being rewarded with both more margin, more profitability, more cash flows, and at the end of the day, more cash being returned to investors.""

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) stock is experiencing a decline on Thursday after the company reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the cloud computing company disappointing on its second-quarter guidance. Salesforce posted its first revenue miss in nearly two decades, compounded by its guidance. RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the software sector. Jaluria notes that Salesforce's performance showed ""this is a tough environment that we're in,"" referring to macro conditions for the software landscape. He highlights that with the revenue miss and disappointing guidance, Salesforce is ""skating that line of no longer being a double-digit grower anymore,"" causing investor concern and the subsequent stock plunge. Jaluria observes that as companies focus on generative AI and implementing and investing in an AI strategy, it is taking precedence over its cloud platform. He states, ""CIOs are taking a look at their IT budgets and saying, 'Where can we scrutinize spend, what is truly necessary, where can we reduce costs?'"" He later adds, ""I think that is leading to a deprioritization of migration from the cloud."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

[Headline]: Why software stocks have 'legs,' upside potential: Strategist
[Summary]: Software stocks are gaining attention as investors identify potential market upside. Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that ""AI would disintermediate"" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been ""overdone,"" pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: ""We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks."" He adds, ""It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside.""

[Headline]: One analyst's biggest software winners under AI push
[Summary]: AI has many on Wall Street captivated as more companies integrate artificial intelligence into their systems or widen development spending into AI-powered products. In the tightening AI race, who will stand to benefit the most early on, and who can be expected to catch up? Guggenheim senior research analyst and senior managing director of software John DiFucci joins Market Domination to give insight into how investors can navigate the software space under AI catalysts. DiFucci points out which sectors have the most to gain from AI at this moment, especially cybersecurity. ""You probably get the development platforms that benefit more, beyond that and cloud vendors and maybe the data preparation vendors, they probably benefit. But beyond that, it's really hard to tell,"" DiFucci tells Yahoo Finance. DiFucci claims Oracle (ORCL) is a good pick that will benefit from the AI buzz: ""There's several reasons for it frankly when it comes down to it. We just think that over time, they're going to continue to put up really good numbers and you're going to see their cash flow grow.""

[Headline]: 'No one's winning' in AI software yet: Jefferies' Thill
[Summary]: Big Tech investors are questioning whether large CapEx (capital expenditures) spending on emerging AI technology — namely from Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) — are making impacts as the tightening artificial intelligence race heats up Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill joins Catalysts to give insight into the state of AI adoption in mega-cap tech stocks and how it may need some more time before the technology gains major traction and starts showing results in earnings. Thill breaks down the situation with the tech giants' AI efforts: ""Microsoft told you a year ago that it would be the fastest business to $10 billion. They haven't said a peep about hitting that target. Microsoft is going to be a $250 billion dollar-plus company. That means it's a low single digit percent of their total revenue. Amazon (AMZN), they don't even break out the number. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), how is the AI product going? Well, there's no financial impact right now. Like, so Salesforce (CRM), they're not selling AI. Adobe (ADBE) it's tiny... it's tiny for everyone. "" He brings it back to Snowflake's (SNOW) current situation: ""It's not like this is Snowflake losing and everyone else is winning. No one's winning in software in AI because it's so early. There's no revenue, but there will be. And so the point is, do you want to invest?""

[Headline]: Salesforce hails 'next wave' in gen AI with custom agents
[Summary]: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has long touted the company’s advantage when it comes to enterprise AI, pointing to the sheer amount of data it has access to. Its new platform Agentforce looks to capitalize on that by deploying generative AI-driven digital agents grounded in companies’ customized data. Agentforce is at the center of Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce Conference, which attracts tens of thousands of its customers and partners to San Francisco every year. As the world’s largest provider of customer relationship management software, Salesforce (CRM) is betting on Agentforce to drive the next wave of growth, as it looks to keep pace with rivals, including Microsoft (MSFT). Sales and service agents on the platform operate autonomously 24 hours a day, handling basic inquiries that can then be handed off to human agents. Utilizing every piece of information stored in Salesforce’s Data Cloud, generative AI enables the development of custom agents that can respond to conversational language, allowing robots to learn and reason in real-time, unlike chatbots that respond to pre-determined questions. Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, said the new agents eliminate the frustration stemming from old bots. “It would ask us the same questions over and over again,” she said. “These service agents from AgentForce, they really understand a wide range of human language and vernacular and can map that to what are the trusted data sources.” The latest product launch comes as Salesforce looks to gain momentum following slowing sales growth stemming from a pullback in customer investments. A handful of companies including Disney (DIS), OpenTable, Kaiser Permanente, and ADP (ADP) have piloted Agentforce so far, but Salesforce is targeting wide adoption, after showcasing the technology at Dreamforce. Benioff said he’s aiming to have one thousand agents deployed by the end of the event.

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) is in focus with its annual Dreamforce conference underway. The big topic of discussion is artificial intelligence (AI), with issues such as safety, regulation, and even the possibility that AI could create job losses. Brad Smith and Madison Mills examine Salesforce's stock movement in the context of recent AI regulation news. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi sat down with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff to discuss the state of AI regulation as the tech advances. ""I think that we are doing a lot of the right things, but we don't know necessarily what the wrong things are because the future is still somewhat undetermined,"" Benioff says. At the Salesforce conference, California Governor Gavin Newsom is signing three bills into law that target the misuse of AI-created content in an effort to combat election misinformation. The governor has been outspoken about the need for AI regulation after Elon Musk, Tesla and Space X CEO and X (formerly Twitter) owner, shared a deep fake video featuring altered footage of Vice President Kamala Harris.

[Headline]: Why pay parity needs to be a core value: Salesforce CEO
[Summary]: Business leaders often avoid talking about inequity and inequality of any kind; after all, it is their job to keep the company out of trouble, so why address an issue you're not prepared to solve? Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff didn't follow that playbook when he spoke with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at Dreamforce last week, as he spoke very directly on Salesforce's efforts toward pay parity. ""We're committed to equality in our company; it's a core value. Men and women will get paid equally for the same work,"" he stated. Without hesitation, he even added a frank takeaway: ""It wasn't very hard to do."" For full episodes of Opening Bid, watch on our website or listen on your favorite podcast platform.

[Headline]: The best and worst AI automation plays: Good Buy or Goodbye
[Summary]: As AI seeps into all corners of the market, Zeno Mercer, VettaFi senior research analyst, joins the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye to lay out the best and worst automation plays. Mercer notes that the COVID pandemic brought to light major issues with global supply chains, especially regarding ports and labor. Thus, he highlights the robotics sector and Cargotec (CGCBV.HE) as a top pick, explaining that it is well-positioned with ""cargo handling, maritime logistics, forklifts and all these ingredients that come together to help automate ports."" In addition, the company has exposure in construction, giving it exposure to two major end markets. He also explains that robotics will benefit from reshoring and the energy transition: ""One of the major costs of automation, from an operating perspective, is energy. So as we're seeing all these investments in data centers and nuclear, for example, that will reduce the operating cost of running things."" Mercer adds that the top port in the US is ranked 53 globally, and says, ""so we clearly have a lot of need to reduce this friction point."" Thus, Cargotec is positioned to help with manufacturing logistics, especially as robotics becomes more collaborative with humans. However, there are potential risks in the sector. As the port strike brought to light issues with automation, Mercer says, ""We shouldn't really allow ourselves to be kind of kneecapped by a group... saying no to automation is really not a great idea. I mean, if we did that to everything, we would never advance as an economy."" On the other hand, Mercer is bearish on Salesforce (CRM), believing it is over-reliant on user-based licensing: ""Right now, the way Salesforce operates is, it's very hands-on. It takes a lot of work to set up. And that has been a moat for them for many years. But the way they work is also primarily license-based on sales teams, number of users, and things like that. And so the way kind of the world is transitioning, we're starting to see more agents, AI agents if you will, that are helping with sales, customer service, marketing, all these things are increasingly commoditized in a way."" He adds that he has ""muted"" expectations for Salesforce based on its future performance and ability to maintain growth, especially as players like HubSpot (HUBS) pose competition. ""We just don't see that obvious path to monetization directly in the way that they're operating right now,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

Wedbush managing director of equity research Scott Devitt joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss the firm's expectations for the next stage of AI and which companies are positioned to gain.

The second stage is ""the application phase of the cycle, which should benefit software companies as well as the cloud providers. And then, phase three of this will ultimately be the consumer-facing companies figuring out how to use the technology in ways that actually can drive increased interactions with consumers."" The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Wedbush highlights Salesforce (CRM), Elastic (ESTC), Snowflake (SNOW), and Palantir (PLTR) as software names posed to gain as well as Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) in the cloud hyperscaler space.

[Headline]: Salesforce Q3 results will be 'more of the same': Analyst
[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) is set to report its third quarter earnings after Tuesday's market close, with Piper Sandler equity research analyst, cloud software and analytics Brent Bracelin providing insights into what investors can anticipate. Bracelin maintains an Overweight rating with a $395 price target on the stock. While he expects ""more of the same"" from Salesforce's report, he notes that the ""narrative is shifting."" He points to the growing use of AI agents, which Bracelin believes ""could really be a catalyst that could kickstart growth for the company"" in the long term. ""But remember we're coming from a point where people were negative on Salesforce for the last two years,"" Bracelin states. He highlights a key risk: the potential for the company to guide its fourth quarter backlog to 8% growth, which falls short of Wall Street's 9% expectation. Bracelin sees a ""silver lining from a financial perspective"" in the company's free cash flow despite these challenges.

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) shares gain in after-hours trading after the company reported mixed quarterly results, with revenue beating estimates while earnings per share (EPS) fell short. CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to share his read of the earnings results. ""Overall, the results were fairly kind of in line, I'd say. [It was] somewhat mixed overall, but you kind of look at the quarter here, the October quarter grew the top line about 8% ... slightly better than expected. It was a slight miss on the on the bottom line side of things,"" Zino outlines. He adds, ""More importantly, is what they guided towards in the January quarter, and that was the fact that they're looking for top-line growth of 8%, [which implies] the growth rates are finally starting to stabilize here for Salesforce."" ""We're absolutely a believer of the name,"" the analyst says, noting, ""We've seen software really underperform here over the last year or so at least relative to other areas of tech like semiconductors. We think software returns back more into favor into 2025, especially on the [software as a service] SaaS side of things, which has kind of been among the worst performing areas of tech."" When it comes to Salesforce specifically, he says the company's recently unveiled artificial intelligence (AI) agent is ""important"" as ""it actually gives investors an idea of what this strategy is going to look like as far as AI is concerned"" and mitigates some of the ""the headwinds for Salesforce, as far as AI has been concerned, is that they've kind of got this subscription-based offering out there, being pressured by enterprises out there."" Zino says Salesforce's AI strategy revolves around the data across its ecosystem. ""They give kind of the enterprise space a real reason to go on and actually pay for the Salesforce platform"" with their subscription-based offerings as well as their consumption-based model, that ""we think will help kind of improve the story for Salesforce going into 2025.""

[Summary]: Ahead of Adobe (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) reporting earnings, BNP Paribas Exane global head of software research Stefan Slowinski joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss his strategy for navigating software stocks in 2025, which he expects to be the year of artificial intelligence (AI) agents. Slowinski says the software sector has made a ""180-degree turn"" in the last six months of 2024, with a ""turn in sentiment"" that ""AI agents are finally the killer app that allows companies to monetize Gen AI."" Among the software players, Slowinski names Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) as stocks still trading at ""reasonable"" valuations that are positioned to gain from the adoptions of AI agents and copilots. On the other hand, Adobe (ADBE) is one he has worries about. ""Part of our concern around Adobe is just the increasing competition from the hyperscalers,"" like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Wedbush Securities global head of technology research Dan Ives says the company is ""transforming the AI revolution."" ""What Palantir has, no one else could compete with. When you think about who could be the next Oracle (ORCL), the next Salesforce (CRM), I believe it's Palantir,"" Ives tells Yahoo Finance, advising investors to look at the stock's potential over the next 3-5 years. When asked what says Palantir apart, Ives points to their intellectual property, arguing that ""no one matches"" it. As far as valuation concerns go, Ives shrugs them off. ""If you just focus on valuation, you've missed all the transformational tech winners, from Apple (AAPL) to Meta (META) to Google (GOOGL, GOOG) to Tesla (TSLA) and others.""

[Headline]: Analyst warns Salesforce investors about AI agent optimism
[Summary]: In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff touted the company's AI agents. But investors may not want to get too excited about them just yet. D.A. Davidson senior software analyst Gil Luria thinks that these agents are not ""going to be enough of a success to drive revenue for a company that may approach $40 billion of revenue next year."" Luria notes that the pricing models for AI agents are still a work in progress and that Salesforce (CRM) is trying a different method. ""What Salesforce is suggesting now is a per-transaction model. That actually scares customers because they don't want success to become a problem. If their users use this tool too much, then they're gonna have an unpredictable bill."" Luria suggests that customers will need to adjust to being charged per transaction and, as a result, it will ""probably only drive very moderate revenue next year,"" he says. So how do you play AI agents? What the video above to hear Luria's answer. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
