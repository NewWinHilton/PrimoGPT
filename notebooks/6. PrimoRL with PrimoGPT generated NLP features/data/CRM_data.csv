The whole week wasn't great for the cloud-based enterprise software leader (shares fell 3.5% the last five trading days), and its peer Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is a likely scapegoat.  Adobe released its Q1 fiscal 2022 earnings report this past week (for the three-month period ended March 4, 2022), and revenue and adjusted earnings were in line with expectations.

[Summary]: Shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the cloud-based customer relationship-management company, were sliding this morning as investors grow increasingly pessimistic about high-growth technology stocks.

As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down by 2.9% by mid-afternoon.

[Summary]: So far, six of the ""magnificent seven"" tech companies have reported their quarterly results: Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA). Nvidia (NVDA) will report on August 23, after the market close. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says he was ""very pleased"" with results so far, despite a low-bar being set for companies this quarter. Morgan, for example, points to online ad spend rates numbers from Meta and Google being better than expected. Morgan describes Microsoft and Apple's reports as ""muted,"" saying the companies reported ""good numbers, they weren't bad numbers, but they didn't beat hugely on the upside and didn't create a catalyst or surprise,"" like with Google, Meta, and Amazon. Some of the companies Morgan says he will be watching for results from are Cisco (CSCO) on August 16, Snowflake (SNOW) on August 23, Applied Materials (AMAT) on August 17, and Salesforce (CRM), which has yet to announce its earnings release date.

[Summary]: The Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference is set to begin Tuesday, September 5th. Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs U.S. Software Equity Research Analyst, explains ""three big things"" to look out for from the conference. Rangan says what he's telling clients ""to look for is what kind of uptick we’re going to see with generative AI"" in calendar ’24. Rangan notes that ""we’ve seen a slew of launches"" from companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Adobe (ADBE), and these companies are hoping ""to get more customer wallet share in return for all the productivity."" ""So when is that going to start to really manifest in revenue?,"" Rangan says. The second thing is ""what’s happening with macro?,"" Rangan says. Last year, ""we were heading into this inflation spiral... company growth rates start to really decelerate,"" Rangan notes, but ""now, we’re at a point where things are stabilizing."" So, Rangan says, ""what is your macro outlook? What is the pulse of the spending environment?"" and ""what do budgets for calendar ’24 look like?"" The third thing is, ""when are you going to start to hire?,"" Rangan says. ""There’s no growth in the software industry unless you really hire,"" Rangan explains. We’ve seen layoffs and hiring freezes, but when is ""that going to start to turn around?,"" Rangan adds. Be sure to tune in next week to see Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi's interviews with some of the biggest names attending the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) stock was upgraded from ""Peer Perform"" to ""Outperform"" with a price target of $315 per share by Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin, Wolfe Research Managing Director & Head of Software Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the upgrade as well as what could happen if Salesforce got involved in a potential merger or acquisition. ""If they do go down that road, I think the ability to... pick and choose and very cogently outline the profitability potential, and the accretion potential of the M&A is going to be very important,"" Zukin says on M&A activity. ""My opinion is that you're going to be looking at Salesforce to do more tuck-ins, more [of] the aqua-hire type of deals rather than the big meaty diluted M&A of the past.""

                [Headline]: Bill Gates, Nasdaq, Verizon CEOs on AI: Davos highlights
[Summary]: Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland continues as Yahoo Finance sat down with top leaders to discuss the impact of AI. Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. “AI can be used… for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon…. Whenever we have new technologies, they’re used to achieve positive goals and… for some challenging things as well,” Gates notes. “When we computers, books, video games... we had to think… what’s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those… negative things.” Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that “AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you’ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta’s AI products have benefited advertisers. “Back in ’22, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they’re doing that is because it’s giving them better targeting and better performance,” Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that “generative AI will be important for our... business.” “When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it’s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains “what’s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then… how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the “exciting opportunities” that come with AI. “I’m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we’re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been… traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,” Benioff says. “Right now AI can really… make people a lot better.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. “I think it’s incredibly early… with AI right now,” Robbins says. “As this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp explains that “76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they’re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it’s the future. And that it’s actually mainstream at this point.” “It really is getting to the point where we’re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,” Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company’s drug development. “Impacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,” Narasimhan notes. “It is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.” Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI “is an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and… ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.” “We’ve been… engaging in artificial intelligence for… well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services. Gen AI gives another gear to that,” Smith adds.

[Headline]: Bill Gates, will.i.am, top execs on AI: Davos best moments
[Summary]: Advancements in artificial intelligence have been one of the biggest stories of 2023 and remain a trending topic for 2024. As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I found it's a real productivity increase,"" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. ""Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better."" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, ""Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at."" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, ""We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability."" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, ""I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network."" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, ""We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons."" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, ""I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have."" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, ""There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still."" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, ""It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast."" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, ""I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question."" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, ""Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big."" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, ""We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost."" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, ""It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.""

[Summary]: Salesforce (CRM) has joined a now long list of companies that announced layoffs in the tech sector. According to data from Layoffs.fyi, the announcement brings the total number of layoffs in the tech sector 24,000 so far in 2024. Should others in the tech industry take this as a sign of things to come? University of Michigan's Ford School Professor of Public Policy and Economics Betsey Stevenson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the status of the labor trends in large tech companies. Stevenson puts the current market in historical context, reminding that the tech sector over hired during the pandemic. ""It's obviously not as booming as a labor market as it was... a year and a half ago, but the question will be, is this tech sector a canary in the coal mine? Or is this more re-allocation to places where we need people more than we need them in the tech sector?"" Stevenson states. ""I think we do still have a healing economy, so I feel very confident that people are going to be reabsorbed into other parts of the labor market.""

[Headline]: Salesforce history: Beyond the Ticker
[Summary]: Over the past quarter of a century, Salesforce (CRM) has become one of the global leaders in the cloud-based software industry. In 2022 alone, Salesforce's revenue topped $31 billion, a more than 18% year-over-year increase. But what led to Salesforce's growth in the cloud computing industry? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at some of the company's biggest moments. 1999 Salesforce was founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez, specializing in software as a service (SaaS). 2000 The dot com bubble burst, and the company was forced to lay off 20% of its employees. On February 7, 2000, Salesforce.com officially launched an event themed around “The End of Software” at San Francisco’s Regency Theater featuring The B-52s. 2003 Salesforce continued to grow, with its revenue skyrocketing to over $100 million by December 2003. 2004 In June 2004, the company went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange at $11 per share. 2009 Salesforce had an annual revenue of just over $1 billion. That same year, Salesforce launched Service Cloud for customer service and support automation. 2014 Salesforce debuted Trailhead, a free online learning platform empowering anyone — regardless of education level — to develop the skills needed to land top tech jobs. 2016 The company launched Einstein, the first comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) technology for customer relationship management (CRM), making AI accessible to every company and business user. 2020 Salesforce was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing energy giant ExxonMobil (XOM). 2021 Salesforce completed the acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date. 2023 The company introduced the next generation of Einstein AI, Einstein GPT, the world’s first generative AI for CRM. From its humble beginnings to a market cap of over $276 billion, Salesforce now stands as one of the world's most distinguished software companies. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

[Headline]: How Salesforce is seriously investing in itself
[Summary]: Shares of Salesforce (CRM) are moving up as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 versus an expected $2.27. The company did, however, forecast a weak sales growth of only an estimated 8.6% growth. In addition, the company announced it will eventually be issuing dividends to shareholders. Macquarie Head of AI & Software Research Fred Havemeyer joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Salesforce's earnings and what to expect from the company going forward. Havemeyer speaks on the shareholder dividend news: ""With the addition of a dividend here and the company also consistently returning capital to investors through buybacks, what we're seeing is that we believe Salesforce here is really showing their dedication to deploying their cash flows in ways that are rewarding investors and their confidence in Salesforce. And so, where the company is focusing again on profitability and cash flows, and growing those cash flows nicely, north of 20% year-over-year in 2025, fiscal '25, they see this as an opportunity to return more cash to shareholders."" He continues: ""It adds a very nice aspect to this story, that you can follow along for the growth, for the upside from AI, but you're also being rewarded with both more margin, more profitability, more cash flows, and at the end of the day, more cash being returned to investors.""

                [Headline]: Why software stocks have 'legs,' upside potential: Strategist
[Summary]: Software stocks are gaining attention as investors identify potential market upside. Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that ""AI would disintermediate"" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been ""overdone,"" pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: ""We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks."" He adds, ""It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside.""
