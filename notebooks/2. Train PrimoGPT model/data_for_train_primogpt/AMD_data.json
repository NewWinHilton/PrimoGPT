[Headline]: What Microsoft, Google and OpenAI don't want you to know about artificial intelligence: Raoul Pal [Summary]: Real Vision Group Founder & CEO Raoul Pal talks to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre about how the big tech companies will develop AI in the next few years.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time, and its potential impact on the global economy cannot be overstated. However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.

[Headline]: AMD Keeps the AI Dream Alive Enough [Summary]: The chip maker more commonly known as AMD has been the second-hottest semiconductor stock this year next to Nvidia That meant a share-price gain of 82% ahead of its second-quarter results late Tuesday—a huge jump considering the near-term pressures the company is facing from the still-sluggish market for personal computers and reduced spending on more traditional data-center components, as tech giants shift their focus to the tools needed to enable generative artificial intelligence. Both were in line to slightly above Wall Street’s projections, but data-center segment revenue still showed its first decline since AMD began breaking out its results in 2021—and came in short of analysts’ projections. The chip maker that successfully broke through Intel’s stranglehold on the market for central processor chips used in data centers is developing a new class of graphic processors, or GPUs, designed for artificial intelligence uses in those same data centers.

[Headline]: Next in Tech: Why generative AI will explode in 2024 [Summary]: It's been just over a year since ChatGPT started to dominate headlines. The OpenAI platform introduced the world to generative AI, a type of AI that can be used in everyday functions. But what will 2024 bring? More AI. Bob O’Donnell, TECHnalysis Research President & Chief Analyst joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the next wave of AI means for users, companies, and investors. Despite the craze over generative AI in the past year, O’Donnell says that not many people in the workforce have been directly using the applications, but that’s all going to change in the coming year. While everyday people are going to be using AI, businesses are going to see a greater impact than the average consumer, O’Donnell maintains. Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest name associated with AI, but \"in 2024, we're going to see a ton of other semiconductor companies, obviously, be going after Nvidia. And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition,” O’Donnell says. In terms of semiconductors, O'Donnell points to announcements from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and how those companies will be looking to bring their chips to the masses. He also explains how tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are going to join the ring with Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM), pioneering the next generation of AI-processing software.For more episodes from our NEXT series, click here.

Bob O’Donnell, TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance Live and shares what he expects to see at CES. Although there are going to be startups leaving their mark in audio and video applications, O’Donnell makes the case that the big tech companies are going to see the greatest earnings in 2024. The smaller companies are going to be financially challenged with building the foundation models that are essential for creating new and accurate AI systems, O’Donnell says, while companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) will be a case of the \"big getting bigger.\" For more from this episode of NEXT: To see the full NEXT episode: Next in Tech: Why generative AI will explode in 2024, click here.

The battle for AI PCs has begun as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and other chip players roll out hardware aimed at AI supremacy. Jason Banta, AMD Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Client OEM, sits down with Yahoo Finance Anchor Akiko Fujita to discuss what features consumers can expect to come in the first leg of the AI PC race. \"Using generative AI or inferencing in the cloud, there are costs associated with that, typically that is the person who is using the device or using that experience is paying a cloud provider to access those generative AI capabilities,\" Banta says. \"By having it local on the device, that AI model is really running closer to the user without accessing the cloud and requiring those cloud costs.\" Click here to view more of Yahoo Finance's coverage of CES 2024 this week, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.

Keenan said, \"The deep fakes, these are one of the major risks that IP lawyers, tech lawyers talk about ... Also, AI that impacts government infrastructure, that's another big area of concern.\" U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) is a part of the bipartisan effort introducing the Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act to Congress, which aims to provide AI regulatory guidelines. Rep. Lieu explained, \"What this bill does is it mandates that the standards set forth by the (National) Institute of Standards and Technology be applied to both the Federal government as well as any companies that want to contract with the Federal government.\" Tom Davenport, Babson College President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management, discussed the adoption of AI and AI regulation across the globe. Davenport said, \"A lot of potential opportunity. The biggest barrier now is in the data and how organizations get their data ready for generative AI.\" Monetizing AI (00:01:37) AI Now Institute Co-Founder and Chief Advisor Meredith Whittaker broke down the recent tech sector layoffs and restructurings that have been fueled by AI. Whittaker said, \"I think what we need is to see increased union density, so workers have more leverage over deciding where AI is introduced and how it's used.\" Boosted.ai Co-Founder and CEO Joshua Pantony highlighted the benefits of using generative AI models for investing, and how it is different from past generations of investing programs. Pantony explained, \"If you use a system like ours, you're going to be able to learn information a lot faster. And the other side is really around efficiency of your process.\" Legal woes (00:02:14) Ryan Abbott, Brown Neri Smith & Khan, LLP Partner, broke down legal precedents surrounding AI including patent and copyright infringement laws. \"What we're fundamentally seeing is this new sort of activity where you have machines that are behaving like people, and legal systems that were designed with human centric concepts,\" Abbott said. \"A company like Novo Nordisk (NVO) uses AI to develop Wegovy or Ozempic, can they patent something like that, or do you need a traditional human inventor?\" Accenture (ACN) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty discussed AI data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers. Daugherty explained, \"There hasn't been anything like generative AI ... it is different. The reason is one, the speed ... the second is this human-like nature of the technology. And as a result of that, it changes everything that people do.\" Election risk (00:02:59) Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down how AI will impact the U.S. Presidential election in 2024 and what Americans need to be on the lookout for. Newman said, \"Disinformation in elections is not new ... so I think what's going to be new in 2024 is just the sophistication of the bogus information. It's a lot easier to use AI to do fake videos that look like real people, fake audio recordings.\" Generative AI speaker and advisor Nina Schick discussed the political ramifications to come from the AI boom. Schick explained, \"When people start to understand that anything can be synthetic, anything can be AI generated, anything can be faked, they begin to lose trust in everything. And I think that is one of the core challenges we're facing.\" Video highlights: 00:00:05 - Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley 00:00:26 - Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor 00:00:46 - Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan 00:01:04 - U.S. Rep.

[Headline]: New Arm offering to speed creation of custom data center chips [Summary]: Arm Holdings on Wednesday released a new set of blueprints for making chips that it says could cut the time required to develop data center processors to less than a year. Arm, whose underlying technology is widely used in the semiconductor industry and powers virtually every smartphone in the world, has been working to take market share away from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices in the market for data central processors, or CPUs. Arm, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank Group, argues that its CPUs will become the preferred pairing with Nvidia's chips in many artificial intelligence data centers, which has helped drive Arm's shares up more than 60% this year. [Headline]: How Nvidia's Q4 earnings set the stage for further dominance [Summary]: Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose after market close on Wednesday after the company posted its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $22.10 billion in revenue versus an expected $20.62 billion. The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share. Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results. Chkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: \"Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.\" Speaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: \"I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter.\" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: \"The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

While some fear that what goes up must come down, other investors believe these stocks still have room to grow. Mizuho Americas Desk Based Analyst Jordan Klein and KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh join Yahoo Finance to discuss how far the momentum can go and which names are best positioned to outperform the broader trend. Vinh explains that while companies such as Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) recorded increases from AI-related businesses, the gains did not compensate for worse-than-expected performance in other domains: \"Both Marvell and Broadcom reported overnight... their AI businesses grew well over 100% for each of those companies but obviously in the near term we are going through kind of a broader inventory correction, particularly on enterprise, seeing some de-stocking activity there. So obviously in the near term it's obviously not enough to offset some of those sort of headwinds, but I think longer term I think if you are an AI bull we certainly still have conviction in the longer term stories related to these AI names. As investor sentiment on semiconductors begins to resemble a frenzy, Klein relays some of his uneasiness regarding the momentous tech rally: \"I'm uneasy just because of the way the stocks are trading. I'm not uneasy at all about the fundamentals, what some of these companies are saying and doing particularly Nvidia and AMD (AMD) and Broadcom and Marvell or the memory companies or semi-cap equipment. I think there is a real long runway for further growth and upside, but I'm always fearful when you get this fear of missing out kind of chase mentality amongst investors.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

U.S. President Joe Biden has long been under pressure to revoke a license, issued by the Trump administration, that allows Intel to ship advanced central processors to Huawei for use in laptops. The push came from Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices , which argued it was unfair that it did not receive a license to sell similar chips to Huawei and from China hawks, who are seeking to stop all sales to the Chinese firm.

The move comes as TikTok faces a potential ban in the United States. Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Bokeh Capital Partners Kimberly Forrest joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why she believes this announcement is a \"tit for tat\" scenario. Forrest notes that China's new policy \"reflects last week's TikTok announcement,\" which she believes is the Chinese government's way of \"matching\" American efforts to regulate some of its most popular products. However, she states that the possibility of either of these announcements being fully implemented is \"very unlikely,\" describing the situation as \"political positioning.\" Forrest advises investors to separate the political factors when determining whether to invest in these companies. She emphasizes that what politicians want to happen may not always align with what is actually feasible.

This development comes as the semiconductor sector undergoes a sector-wide correction. Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Market Domination to provide insights into this situation. Rasgon acknowledges that while the chip sector is undergoing a correction, \"outside of AI\" the industry has not been performing well. He notes that other segments of the sector, such as automotive, data centers, PCs, and smartphones, \"are not all that great,\" which could be contributing to the sector-wide pressure, in addition to the disappointing earnings from major players. Rasgon shifts the focus to the question of \"the pace of the recovery,\" noting that the stocks have held up \"remarkably\" despite the revisions, suggesting this is \"a delayed reaction.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

[Headline]: AI investments will help chip sector to recover: Analyst [Summary]: The semiconductor sector is undergoing a correction as interest rate cut expectations dwindle, prompting concerns about the impact on these high-growth, technology-driven stocks. Wedbush Enterprise Hardware Analyst Matt Bryson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the dynamics shaping the chip industry. Bryson acknowledges that the rise of generative AI has been a significant driving force behind the recent success of chip stocks. While he believes that AI is shifting \"the way technology works,\" he notes it will take time. Due to this, Bryson highlights that \"significant investment\" will continue to occur in the chip market, fueled by the growth of generative AI applications. However, Bryson cautions that as interest rates remain elevated, it could \"weigh on consumer spending.\" Nevertheless, he expresses confidence that the AI revolution \"changing the landscape for tech\" will likely insulate the sector from the effect of high interest rates, as investors are unwilling to miss out on the \"next technology\" breakthrough.

Harvest Portfolio Management CIO and partner Paul Meeks comes on Catalysts to share his perspective on the current market rotations. Meeks reveals he's refraining from buying tech stocks at the moment. While he remains \"pretty comfortable with the continued AI infrastructure building names,\" he acknowledges that regardless of fundamental performance, stock prices could still decline. \"So what I am doing is I have a prohibition on buying [tech stocks] at least till we get through next week's reports,\" he explains. In terms of specific investments, Meeks highlights several AI infrastructure plays, including Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Dell (DELL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI). However, for other AI-related companies, he emphasizes the need to see \"more use cases\" before gaining confidence in investing.

Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss the semiconductor industry's current state. Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, \"any hiccup, any rumor of something\" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to \"look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go,\" highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. \"They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out,\" he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: \"That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
