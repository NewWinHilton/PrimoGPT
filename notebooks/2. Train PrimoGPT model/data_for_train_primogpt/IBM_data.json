[RECENT NEWS] Here are the recent news articles related to IBM: [Headline]: IBM Earnings to Test Top Tech Stock of 2022 [Summary]: Information technology provider IBM (IBM) heads into its earnings report after Wednesday's closing bell having handily outperformed glitzier tech bellwethers over the past year, an unusual position for a technology pioneer that has badly lagged the sector in returns over the longer term. IBM should post fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.59 per share, up from $3.35 per share a year earlier, while revenue may have slipped 2% to $16.4 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. IBM's defensive positioning as a provider of essential enterprise IT software and services with a high proportion of recurring revenue has propped up the share price but will be tested by the recent slowdown in tech spending.

President Joe Biden has seemed to be in the second camp, and is targeting stock buybacks after companies poured billions into the practice during a period of high inflation over the past two years, and while laying off workers this year. Biden supported a 1% tax on dollars spent on buybacks, which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in August.

[Headline]: What Microsoft, Google and OpenAI don't want you to know about artificial intelligence: Raoul Pal [Summary]: Real Vision Group Founder & CEO Raoul Pal talks to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre about how the big tech companies will develop AI in the next few years.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time, and its potential impact on the global economy cannot be overstated. However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.

[Headline]: Microsoft history: Beyond the Ticker [Summary]: From Windows and Azure to Word and Xbox, Microsoft’s (MSFT) products have made it a household name and tech powerhouse. In 2023 alone, the company generated over $211 billion in revenue, and currently boasts a market cap of more than $3 trillion, making it the wealthiest publicly traded company in the world. What led to that success? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at the company's biggest moments. 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975 to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. 1980 Microsoft signed a contract with IBM (IBM) to bundle Microsoft's operating system, an early version of its MS-DOS, with IBM computers. 1985 Microsoft announced the first version of Windows, an operating system composed of a graphical user interface running on top of MS-DOS. 1986 On March 13, 1986, Microsoft kicked off its IPO, raising $61 million at $21 per share. 1995 On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95. The software would go on to be wildly popular among PC consumers and enterprise customers. 2000 Steve Ballmer took the reins at Microsoft, succeeding Bill Gates as the company’s second CEO. 2001 The company jumped headlong into the console gaming wars with the debut of the first Xbox. 2008 Microsoft dove into the cloud computing space with its Azure service. 2014 Ballmer retired as Microsoft CEO, turning over the position to Satya Nadella. 2019 Microsoft’s market cap crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. 2023 Microsoft kicked off its push into generative AI with a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and the debut of several generative AI products including its revamped Bing search engine and Copilot software. The company is now riding the AI hype train as far as it can, adding generative AI software to everything from Office to Windows and everything in between. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna spoke with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita at the Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss the company's performance, its investments in AI, and how the rest of the world views AI. Krishna speaks on AI regulation in the US: \"I'm not concerned about the US falling behind. What I'm concerned about is that regulators should not regulate the technology. What regulators should regulate is the risk of the use cases. Can you imagine sitting back in 1995, let's regulate the internet, so lets regulate dial-up modems. How useful would that have been to today?\" He continues with: \"Don't regulate the technology. All you will do is it will go offshore, these are digital technologies, but regulate the use case, so we are sure it's being used responsibly. One that I also talk about, is make people who develop models accountable for what the models can do.

IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna joins Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss why he disagrees with Warren Buffett's stance on AI. Krishna dismisses the danger: \"I actually have no such fear. So I'm putting it black and white. I think there's a lot of people who hypothesize, and as you have seen in many technologies, thinking that the rate of progress which has been 100 times over the last 3, 4 years, is going to be another 100 to 1000 times. But just for the current AI, we need this much infrastructure and power for it to be 100 to 1000 times...I think it's a little fantastical to keep predicting that it carries on on an exponential curve.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by IBM CEO Arvind Krishna at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to explain why IBM's valuation may not be on par with other AI stocks. \"We are building, we're staying in the right places that have credibility, we work with enterprise, hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum down the road.
